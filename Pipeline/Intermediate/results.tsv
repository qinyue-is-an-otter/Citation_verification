10.3322/caac.21660	Global cancer statistics 2020: GLOBOCAN estimates of incidence and mortality worldwide for 36 cancers in 185 countries	B1	Gynecologic cancer can affect various organs within the female reproductive system, including the uterus, cervix, vulva, ovary, and vagina. In 2020, there were 313,959 new cases of ovarian cancer, 417,367 new cases of endometrial cancer, and 604,127 new cases of cervical cancer reported worldwide, with recorded death numbers of 207,252, 97,370, and 341,831, respectively ( 1 ). Fortunately, the incidence of cervical cancer has decreased over the past three decades, thanks to routine screening, HPV vaccination, and the management of premalignant lesions. However, the incidence of ovarian and endometrial cancer has increased ( 2 ).

10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-2019	Enhanced killing of primary ovarian cancer by retargeting autologous cytokine-induced killer cells with bispecific antibodies: a preclinical study	B15	"Oncogenesis is a complex process that involves multiple steps and the accumulation of several mutations that affect cell proliferation and equilibrium. Metastasis, which is the spread of cancer cells from the primary tumor to distant tissues and organs, is another complicated process that relies on the activation of several mechanisms. These mechanisms include angiogenesis, infiltration, embolization, survival in the bloodstream, arrest in organs, attachment to vessel walls, and extravasation ( 13 ). To initiate and control tumor progression and metastasis, cancer cells secrete cytokines, and regulatory immune cells play a crucial role in these processes. In response to cellular damage and stress, immune cells release cell signaling molecules that modify immune reactions, reducing cell injury and boosting cell development ( 14 ). However, cancer cells can bypass the immune system’s innate and adaptive defenses by generating antigens ( 15 ,  16 ). The tumor cells interact with the organ environment, known as the “soil and seeds hypotheses,” which is believed to cause metastasis ( 17 ). The cancer cells from the initial tumor are the seeds, and the metastatic site is the soil. Metastasis is the leading cause of mortality for more than 90% of cancer patients, including those with gynecological cancers. Gynecological cancers, such as ovarian and cervical cancer, are caused by genetic mutations that affect cell proliferation and equilibrium. These mutations are randomly produced by damage to DNA and lack or malfunction of DNA repair systems. The mechanisms involved in initiating and advancing metastasis in gynecological cancers include invasion, circulation, intravasation, extravasation, and colonization (

               <jats:p>Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells are ex vivo activated and expanded CD8+ natural killer T cells that have been shown to have antitumor activity. This is the first study exploring cell killing of primary ovarian carcinoma cells with and without bispecific antibodies. Primary cancer cells and autologous CIK cells were collected from women with epithelial ovarian cancer. Bispecific antibodies against cancer antigen-125 (BSAbxCA125) and Her2 (BSAbxHer2) were developed using chemical heteroconjugation. On fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, the expansion of CIK cells resulted in a significant increase of CD3+CD8+ and CD3+CD56+ T cells. With enhancement by bispecific antibodies, the mean percent lysis in a 51Cr release assay of fresh ovarian cancer cells exposed to autologous CIK cells increased from 21.7 ± 0.3% to 89.4 ± 2.1% at an E:T ratio of 100:1 (P &amp;lt; 0.001). Anti-NKG2D antibodies attenuated the CIK activity by 56.8% on primary cells (P &amp;lt; 0.001). In a xenograft severe combined immunodeficient mouse model, real-time tumor regression and progression was visualized using a noninvasive in vivo bioluminescence imaging system. Four hours after CIK cell injection, we were able to visualize CD8+NKG2D+ CIK cells infiltrating Her2-expressing cancer cells on fluorescence microscopy. Mice that underwent adoptive transfer of CIK cells redirected with BSAbxCA125 and BSAbxHer2 had significant reduction in tumor burden (P &amp;lt; 0.001 and P &amp;lt; 0.001) and improvement in survival (P = 0.05 and P = 0.006) versus those treated with CIK cells alone. Bispecific antibodies significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of CIK cells in primary ovarian cancer cells and in our in vivo mouse model. The mechanism of cytolysis seems to be mediated in part by the NKG2D receptor.</jats:p>"
10.1210/jcem.85.11.6942	Angiogenesis in the human corpus luteum: localization and changes in angiopoietins, tie-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor messenger ribonucleic acid	B34	"In gynecological cancers, such as ovarian and cervical cancer, several molecular variables are linked to metastasis, including HOX genes, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, EGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptors, and  vascular endothelial growth factor  (VEGF) ( 27 )—for instance, the ovulatory cycle-induced angiogenesis, the presence of COX-1, and the availability of growth factors offer an ideal environment for the implantation of glioma-initiating cells (GICs) in ovarian cancer (OC). Ovarian cancer commonly presents at advanced stages and can spread through both passive and hematogenous mechanisms ( 
 Figure 2 
 ) ( 28 ). Metastatic ovarian cancer (MOC) accounts for 2.3% to 23.7% of all malignant ovarian tumors that are generally transmitted from other organs. MOC most often arises from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (71%), followed by the appendix (8%), breast (6%), and pancreas (4%), according to a recent research study in Japan. MOC differs from other gynecologic cancers. It has non-obvious symptoms in the early stages (abdominal mass and/or fullness is the most prevalent symptom) and no characteristic imaging findings ( 29 ). Compared to older female GIC patients, younger female GIC patients in the ovulatory period are more likely to develop MOC ( 30 ). The ovary’s ovulatory cycle, according to researchers, creates a perfect environment for GIC cells to survive and penetrate ( 31 ). When an oocyte is released to repair the surface of the ovary following ovulation, the epithelium of the ovary is disturbed by the buildup of steroid hormones. It is comparable to wound healing, which necessitates the formation of new blood vessels ( 32 ). According to other studies, the ovary has all of the  VEGF-A  isoforms, and both  VEGFR-1  and  VEGFR-2  are extensively expressed in ovarian capillaries ( 33 ).  Angiopoietin-2  was expressed in the ovary, which is noteworthy ( 34 ). Furthermore, numerous factors such as oxygen saturation, age, and endocrine function impacted the expression of angiogenic peptides. The ovary contains gonadotropic hormones such as luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). LH and FSH control ovarian angiogenesis by raising the  VEGF  levels dose-dependently ( 35 ). Moreover, LeCouter et al. (2001) discovered the first tissue-specific angiogenic molecule in ovarian tissue, which was obtained from the endocrine gland ( 36 ). Other variables and ovarian angiogenesis increase GIC cell growth, seeding, invasion, and survival.  COX  enzymes have been shown to transfer to eicosanoids, which have been shown to promote GIC cell transformation and proliferation.  COX  is also linked to the existence of  VEGF , which was previously explored.  COX-1  expression was abundant in both normal and malignant ovarian tissue, while  VEGF  was abundant in the same areas.  COX-1  seems to enhance neovascularization and cell proliferation, according to these data. GIC cells metastasizing to the ovary are also regulated by other growth factors such as epidermal growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, and TGF. In conclusion, the ovulatory cycle-induced angiogenesis, the presence of  COX-1 , and the availability of growth factors offer an ideal environment for the implantation of GIC cells ( 37 ,  38 ). Cervical cancer development and metastasis are caused by genetic changes in multiple cell signaling systems that influence the choice of apoptosis or survival."	According to other studies, the ovary has all of the  VEGFA  isoforms, and both  VEGFR1  and  VEGFR2  are extensively expressed in ovarian capillaries  33 . Angiopoietin2  was expressed in the ovary, which is noteworthy  34 .	10.3389/fonc.2023.1215194		<jats:p>In the menstrual cycle, extensive angiogenesis accompanies luteinization. During luteolysis, endothelial cells die, whereas in a conceptual cycle, the corpus luteum (CL) persists, and endothelial cell survival is extended. A main stimulator for angiogenesis is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), while the angiopoietins (Ang-1 and Ang-2) may be important modulators. The aim of this study was to investigate the localization of Ang-1, Ang-2, their common receptor Tie-2, and VEGF messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) at the different stages of the functional luteal phase and after rescue by hCG. Ang-1 mRNA was uniformly expressed at a low level throughout the CL. The signal was highest during the early luteal phase. In contrast, Ang-2 mRNA expression was localized strongly to individual granulosa and thecal luteal and endothelial cells. Administration of hCG was associated with an increase in the Ang-2 mRNA area of expression and grain density in individual luteal and endothelial cells. The Tie-2 receptor mRNA was localized in endothelial cells, and the area of expression was highest during the early luteal phase and during luteal rescue. VEGF mRNA was found exclusively in granulosa luteal cells, and the area of expression was highest in corpora lutea during simulated pregnancy. These results begin to characterize the molecular regulation of the divergent processes involved in luteal angiogenesis during luteinization, luteolysis, and rescue in the human and imply that the angiopoietins are involved during the initial angiogenic phase and in luteal rescue.</jats:p>

Moreover, the 5-year survival of I–II stages varies from 75% to 92%, but around one-third of patients in Western countries are still diagnosed with advanced peritoneal dissemination and ascites ( 39 ). The development of a practical and sensitive approach for the early detection of ovarian cancer is required to reduce the high death rates.

10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-1936	MicroRNA signatures in human ovarian cancer	B41	One approach to discovering diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for ovarian cancer relies on the different levels of expression of certain miRNAs in plasma, ascites fluid, serum, serum exosomes, or tissue biopsies taken from ovarian cancer patients and healthy controls. One study of tissue miRNA expression profiles collected from subjects with ovarian cancer and healthy individuals showed distinct miRNA signature profiles between the two groups. All morphological histotypes of ovarian cancer tissue were included, showing typically elevated levels of miR-141 and miR-200a-c, which typically reduced the miR-125b, miR-199a, miR-140, and miR-145 levels. Furthermore, different miRNA patterns were found in ovarian cancer samples with different histopathological characteristics, i.e., serous, mucinous, and endometrioid as well as clear cell—for instance, miR-212 and miR-302b* were greatly elevated, whereas miR-222 was reduced in the endometrioid histotype compared to the serous histotype ( 41 ).

               <jats:p>Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the sixth most common cancer in women worldwide and, despite advances in detection and therapies, it still represents the most lethal gynecologic malignancy in the industrialized countries. Unfortunately, still relatively little is known about the molecular events that lead to the development of this highly aggressive disease. The relatively recent discovery of microRNAs (miRNA), a class of small noncoding RNAs targeting multiple mRNAs and triggering translation repression and/or RNA degradation, has revealed the existence of a new level of gene expression regulation. Multiple studies involving various types of human cancers proved that miRNAs have a causal role in tumorigenesis. Here we show that, in comparison to normal ovary, miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in human ovarian cancer. The overall miRNA expression could clearly separate normal versus cancer tissues. The most significantly overexpressed miRNAs were miR-200a, miR-141, miR-200c, and miR-200b, whereas miR-199a, miR-140, miR-145, and miR-125b1 were among the most down-modulated miRNAs. We could also identify miRNAs whose expression was correlated with specific ovarian cancer biopathologic features, such as histotype, lymphovascular and organ invasion, and involvement of ovarian surface. Moreover, the levels of miR-21, miR-203, and miR-205, up-modulated in ovarian carcinomas compared with normal tissues, were significantly increased after 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine demethylating treatment of OVCAR3 cells, suggesting that the DNA hypomethylation could be the mechanism responsible for their overexpression. Our results indicate that miRNAs might play a role in the pathogenesis of human EOC and identify altered miRNA gene methylation as a possible epigenetic mechanism involved in their aberrant expression.

10.3322/caac.21660	Global cancer statistics 2020: GLOBOCAN estimates of incidence and mortality worldwide for 36 cancers in 185 countries	B1	Endometrial cancer (EC) has the 19th rank of cancer-attributed mortality among both sexes worldwide ( 1 ). Endometrial cancer is categorized into two subtypes. Type I tumors are frequently preceded by endometrial hyperplasia and are usually endometrioid adenocarcinomas associated with unopposed estrogen stimulation and extreme obesity ( 113 ). Type II tumors arise in atrophic endometrium as primarily serous carcinomas, which are estrogen-independent and less differentiated, with a lower survival rate ( 113 ). Fortunately, most endometrial cancer cases are type I endometrioid, which have a better prognosis ( 114 ). This is primarily due to the fact that women with vaginal bleeding tend to seek treatment earlier, so their disease is diagnosed at an earlier stage ( 115 ). The most recent findings indicate a 5-year survival rate of 48.7% for FIGO stage III and 28.2% for FIGO stage IV disease ( 116 ).

10.1159/000490020	Interaction of E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH7 with long noncoding RNA MALAT1 and autophagy-related protein ATG7 promotes autophagy and invasion in ovarian cancer	B123	The  membrane associated RING-CH  ( MARCH ) protein family, which contains 11 members, is itself a part of the  RING finger E3 Ubiquitin Ligase  protein family.  MARCH7 , commonly referred to as  axotrophin , has been shown to affect proliferation, migration, invasion, immunological tolerance, the actin cytoskeleton, autophagy, and neuronal development in both normal cells and cancer cells ( 123 ).  MARCH7  was upregulated in developing rat spermatides during spermatogenesis, thus controlling the head and tail structural and functional properties ( 124 ). In mice,  MARCH7  knock-down reduced the invasion and proliferation as well as migration of OC cells and prevented OC development ( 123 ). Research has shown that  MARCH7 , a protein that belongs to the  MARCH  family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, is involved in regulating cell and tissue growth and differentiation. Specifically, MARCH7 has been found to be expressed at higher-than-normal levels in stem cells, precursor cells, cancer cells, and certain other cells and tissues ( 125 ). A wide variety of transcription factors (TFs) have been found to be involved in the EMT, including  Snail ,  Zeb , and  Twist . These TFs, in turn, affect several tyrosine kinase receptor signaling pathways, including  Hedgehog ,  β-catenin ,  TGF-β ,  STAT3 ,  Notch ,  Wnt , and  Nanog  ( 126 ). In HUVECs, miR-27b-3p not only suppressed cell proliferation and migration  via Smad7 -mediated modification of  TGF-β  but also sensitized breast cancer cells to several anti-cancer treatments both  in vivo  and  in vitro , suggesting the probable involvement of miR-27b-3p in cancer biology ( 127 ).	In mice,  MARCH7  knock-down reduced the invasion and proliferation as well as migration of OC cells and prevented OC development ( 123 ).	10.3389/fonc.2023.1215194		<jats:p>Background/Aims: Ubiquitin E3 ligase MARCH7 plays an important role in T cell proliferation and neuronal development. But its role in ovarian cancer remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of Ubiquitin E3 ligase MARCH7 in ovarian cancer. Methods: Real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and western blotting analysis were performed to determine the expression of MARCH7, MALAT1 and ATG7 in ovarian cancer cell lines and clinical specimens. The role of MARCH7 in maintaining ovarian cancer malignant phenotype was examined by Wound healing assay, Matrigel invasion assays and Mouse orthotopic xenograft model. Luciferase reporter assay, western blot analysis and ChIP assay were used to determine whether MARCH7 activates TGF-β-smad2/3 pathway by interacting with TGFβR2. Results: MARCH7 interacted with MALAT1 by miR-200a (microRNA-200a). MARCH7 may function as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to regulate the expression of ATG7 by competing with miR-200a. MARCH7 regulated TGF-β-smad2/3 pathway by interacting with TGFβR2. Inhibition of TGF-β-smad2/3 pathway downregulated MARCH7, MALAT1 and ATG7. MiR-200a regulated TGF-β induced autophagy, invasion and metastasis of SKOV3 cells by targeting MARCH7. MARCH7 silencing inhibited autophagy invasion and metastasis of SKOV3 cells both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, MARCH7 overexpression promoted TGF-β induced autophagy, invasion and metastasis of A2780 cells in vitro by depending on MALAT1 and ATG7. We also found that TGF-β-smad2/3 pathway regulated MARCH7 and ATG7 through MALAT1. Conclusions: These findings suggested that TGFβR2-Smad2/3-MALAT1/MARCH7/ATG7 feedback loop mediated autophagy, migration and invasion in ovarian cancer.</jats:p>
10.1126/science.270.5240.1354	Sequence and characterization of a coactivator for the steroid hormone receptor superfamily	B129	"Another study has shown that the  steroid receptor coactivator  family ( SRC-2 ,  SRC-3 , and  SRC-1 ) was discovered to regulate the transcription of estrogen and progesterone receptors as well as other nuclear receptors (NRs) ( 129 ).  SRC  triggers a cascade of downstream signaling pathways, like  PI3K / Akt  pathways and  MAPK / ERK , and regulates numerous cellular processes, particularly migration.  SRC  has been identified to be an important oncoprotein in many cancer types due to its strong regulation of NRs. Researchers have found the over-expression of  SRC  in several tumor types, such as breast cancer ( 130 ). In EC,  SRC  expression has a correlation to the clinical stage and unfavorable prognosis as well as depth of tumor invasion into normal tissue ( 131 ,  132 ). Hu et al. (2019) reported lower levels of miR-449a in advanced endometrial cancer cells. Furthermore, the AN3CA and KLE EC cell lines exhibited a weaker tendency to migrate and invade when miR-449a was over-expressed.  SRC  mRNA would be one of the direct targets of miR-449a, as shown by luciferase reporter assays.  SRC  expression has been greater in advanced EC tissues that had spread to distant sites. miR-449a could downregulate  SRC  to inhibit metastasis and reduce activating  Akt  and  ERK1 / 2  pathways in EC cells ( 133 ).

Coexpression of SRC-1 reversed the ability of the estrogen receptor to squelch activation by hPR. Also, the amino terminal truncated form of SRC-1 acted as a dominant-negative repressor. Together, these results indicate that SRC-1 encodes a coactivator that is required for full transcriptional activity of the steroid receptor superfamily.</jats:p>

10.1002/jcb.28321	microRNA-802 inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in human cervical cancer by targeting serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 9	B162	Epithelial ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, and gastric cancer have all been found to be inhibited by miR-802 acting as a tumor suppressor ( 86 ). miRNA-802 can modulate  serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1  ( SRSF1 ) to inhibit cervical carcinoma cell proliferation and promote cell death ( 162 ). The cytoskeletal protein cluster  myosin regulatory light chain interacting protein  ( MYLIP ) participates in cell migration ( 163 ).  MYLIP  contributes to cell motility, preservation of cellular morphology, remodeling of cytoskeletal proteins, and the adherence of cells to the ECM via interaction with cell membrane proteins ( 164 ). Ni et al. (2021) investigated the potential role of miR-802 in CC growth, invasion, and migration.

They also employed a range of assays, including the CCK-8 assay, transwell invasion assay, scratch wound healing assay, and colony formation assay, to investigate the effects of miR-802 on CC cell proliferation and metastasis. In addition, an  in vivo  mouse xenograft model was used to examine the impact of miR-802 on CC development, and Western blotting and IHC were used to determine the  MYLIP  expression levels. The study found that the miR-802 levels were significantly lower in CC cells and tissues compared to normal cells and tissues. Higher levels of miR-802 were associated with reduced aggressiveness and slower growth of CC cells.

The purposes of this study were to explore the role of miR‐802 in cervical cancer and to clarify the regulation of serine/arginine‐rich splicing factor 9 (SRSF9) by miR‐802. Here, we found that miR‐802 was downregulated in both cervical cancer tissues and cell lines. Transfection of a miR‐802 mimic into cervical cancer cells inhibited their proliferation and colony formation, and promoted cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase and cell apoptosis. In addition, we found that miR‐802 could directly target the 3′‐untranslated region of SRSF9 and suppress SRSF9 expression. Rescue experiments revealed that overexpression of SRSF9 partially reversed the inhibition effect of miR‐802 in cervical cancer cells.

Nevertheless, the bio-function of miR-802 in cervical cancer remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: Hence, we illuminated the potential roles of miR-802 in cervical cancer cell growth, migration, and invasion. METHODS: The levels of miR-802 and myosin regulatory light chain interacting protein (MYLIP) were measured using qRT-PCR assay. The potential effects of miRNA-802 on cervical cancer cell proliferation and metastatic phenotypes were determined using CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing and Transwell invasion assays. MYLIP was validated as a downstream target gene of miRNA-802 using bioinformatics analysis tool and luciferase report gene assay. The impact of miR-802 on the growth of cervical cancer cell in vivo was analyzed using xenograft model. The expression of MYLIP was measured by western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS: MiRNA-802 was distinctly down-regulated in cervical cancer cells as well as clinical cervical cancer samples. Upregulation of miRNA-802 significantly inhibited the growth and aggressiveness of cervical cancer cell. Additional, MYLIP was a functional target of miR-802. MYLIP was ovrerexpressed in cervical cancer and MYLIP level was negatively associated with the level of miR-802. Overexpression of MYLIP eliminated the inhibitory effects of miR-802 on growth and metastatic-related traits of cervical cancer cell. In vivo, miR-802 also markedly reduced the tumor growth of cervical cancer cell and decreased the expression of MYLIP. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-802 inhibits the growth and metastatic-related phenotypes of cervical cancer cell through targeting MYLIP.</jats:p>
10.1002/iub.1433	MiR-199a/b-3p suppresses migration and invasion of breast cancer cells by downregulating PAK4/MEK/ERK signaling pathway	B168	B7-H3  is a  B7  protein family member, which was found to be significantly expressed in tumors such as colon cancer ( 166 ,  167 ) while having minimal (if any at all) expression in most normal cells and tissues. Moreover, miR-199a has been found to play various roles in several cancers, depending on the kind of cancer. miR-199a was substantially lower in breast cancer and CC, where it targeted  B7-H3  to modulate cancer development ( 168 ). Yang et al. (2020) demonstrated a reduction of miRNA-199a in the tissues of cervical cancer, while  B7-H3  was considerably over-expressed compared to the surrounding normal tissue, as shown by qRT-PCR. They also found that miRNA-199a was lower in the cell lines of CC in comparison with the immortalized normal cells. Moreover,  B7-H3  has been shown to be one of the targets of miRNA-199a in CC. The bioinformatics analysis results introduced 3′UTR of  B7-H3  as one of the direct miR-199a targets, which was consistent with the results acquired from a luciferase reporter assay. Furthermore, the 3′-UTR of  B7-H3  has been directly targeted by miRNA-199a; however, the exact signaling mechanisms that contribute to controlling  B7-H3  expression have yet to be elucidated. A series of studies were carried out to see if the inhibitory action of miRNA-199a has been mediated by  B7-H3 . Over-expression of miRNA-199a repressed the proliferation and invasion as well as migration of cancer cells via binding directly to  B7-H3 . Cervical cancer metastasis was found to be dependent on the EMT. miRNA-199a suppressed tumor development in cervical cancer via targeting  B7-H3 , according to Western blotting and qRT-PCR. They also showed that miRNA-199a affected the  Akt/mTOR  signaling pathway via  B7-H3  targeting and that over-expression of miRNA-199a suppressed tumor development  in vivo . Their results could lay the groundwork for the development of future targeted prevention and treatment strategies for cervical cancer ( 169 ).	Moreover, miR-199a has been found to play various roles in several cancers, depending on the kind of cancer. miR-199a was substantially lower in breast cancer and CC, where it targeted  B7-H3  to modulate cancer development ( 168 ).	10.3389/fonc.2023.1215194		<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>MicroRNA‐199a/b‐3p is downregulated in several types of aggressive cancer, and its decrement significantly correlates with poor survival. Here, we aim to investigate the biological function of miR‐199a/b‐3p and its regulation of target genes in breast cancer cells with highly metastatic potential. In addition, we found that miR‐199a/b‐3p expression was much lower in MDA‐MB‐231, CAL120, and HCC1395 breast cancer cells with highly metastatic potential. Functional assays showed that restored miR‐199a/b‐3p expression inhibited MDA‐MB‐231 cell growth, cell‐cycle progression, migration, and invasion. In addition, we experimentally demonstrated that PAK4 was the direct target of miR‐199a/b‐3p, hypo‐expression of PAK4 suppressed proliferation, migration and invasion of MDA‐MB‐231 cells, and overexpression of PAK4 significantly rescued the inhibitory effect of miR‐199a/b‐3p on MDA‐MB‐231 cell growth, migration, and invasion. Further, we also observed that miR‐199a/b‐3p could inactivate the PAK4/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Thus, miR‐199a/b‐3p functions as a tumor suppressor and has an important role in breast cancer metastasis through PAK4/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. © 2015 IUBMB Life, 67(10):768–777, 2015</jats:p>
10.1002/ijc.28010	MiRNA-362-3p induces cell cycle arrest through targeting of E2F1, USF2 and PTPN1 and is associated with recurrence of colorectal cancer	B172	In a study conducted by Dang et al. (2018),  B-cell receptor-associated protein 31  ( BAP31 ) was found to be over-expressed in CC and to play a role in promoting tumor growth and progression. BAP31 is a cancer/testis antigen that is normally highly expressed in the testis and has been implicated in the development of various cancers. Additionally,  BAP31  expression had a correlation to the CC clinical stage and stimulated the proliferation of the CC cells  in vitro . As expected, the inhibition of  BAP31  suppressed CC progression  in vivo  ( 170 ). Several cancers have been found to be suppressed by miR-362, which was downregulated in CC ( 171 ). miR-362 directly inhibited the expression of  E2F1 ,  USF2 , and  PTPN1 , causing cell cycle arrest in colon cancer ( 172 ). miR-362 may also inhibit breast cancer progression by inhibiting the expression of  p130 Crk-associated substrate  ( CAS ) ( 173 ). Yang et al. (2021) discovered that miR-362 was negatively correlated with clinical stage in CC patients and was a major regulator of  BAP31  expression. miR-362 over-expression reduced CC cell growth  in vitro  and increased apoptosis. Additionally, in a xenograft nude mouse model of CC, miR-362 decreased the tumor size and increased the mouse survival time.  BAP31  binds to the  spectrin  isoform  SPTBN1  to form a complex that modulates tumor development via the miR-362-regulated  Smad 2/3  pathway. They showed that miR-362 was an anticancer, anti-proliferation, and pro-apoptotic miRNA in cervical cancer cells, which regulated the  BAP31  and  TGF-β/Smad  pathways. Therefore, increasing the expression of miR-362 could be a possible cervical cancer treatment ( 174 ).	Several cancers have been found to be suppressed by miR-362, which was downregulated in CC ( 171 ). miR-362 directly inhibited the expression of  E2F1 ,  USF2 , and  PTPN1 , causing cell cycle arrest in colon cancer ( 172 ). miR-362 may also inhibit breast cancer progression by inhibiting the expression of  p130 Crk-associated substrate  ( CAS ) ( 173 ).	10.3389/fonc.2023.1215194		<jats:p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in Western countries. A significant number of CRC patients undergoing curatively intended surgery subsequently develop recurrence and die from the disease.

In this study, we identified novel miRNAs associated with recurrence of CRC, and their possible mechanism of action. TaqMan<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> Human MicroRNA Array Set v2.0 was used to profile the expression of 667 miRNAs in 14 normal colon mucosas and 46 microsatellite stable CRC tumors.

A significant association with increased disease free survival was confirmed for miR‐362‐3p in a second independent cohort of 43 CRC patients, using single TaqMan<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> microRNA assays. <jats:italic>In vitro</jats:italic> functional analysis showed that over‐expression of miR‐362‐3p in colon cancer cell lines reduced cell viability, and proliferation mainly due to cell cycle arrest.

Subsequently, these genes were confirmed as direct targets by Luciferase reporter assays and their knockdown <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> phenocopied the effects of miR‐362‐3p over‐expression. We conclude that miR‐362‐3p may be a novel prognostic marker in CRC, and hypothesize that the positive effects of augmented miR‐362‐3p expression may in part be mediated through the targets E2F1, USF2 and PTPN1.</jats:p>

Methods: Fifty-five paired GBM tissues and adjacent normal tissues, GBM cell lines (U118, LN-299, H4, A172, U87-MG, and U251), and normal human astrocyte cell line (HEB) were used. miR-758-5p mimics, ZBTB20 siRNA, and pcDNA3.1-ZBTB20 were transiently transduced into cancer cells independently or together. qRT-PCR was conducted to analyze the expression of miR-758-5p and ZBTB20. Luciferase reporter assays were performed to determine the effect of miR-758-5p on ZBTB20. Western blot was applied to measure the expression of ZBTB20, PCNA, and cleaved caspase3. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8), colony formation, FACS, and Transwell assays were carried out to detect cellular proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. Xenograft experiments were implemented to evaluate tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Results: miR-758-5p was significantly downregulated in GBM tissues and cell lines compared with that in adjacent normal tissues and HEB cells. miR-758-5p overexpression inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GBM cells and induced apoptosis by regulating the ZBTB20 expression. Pearson correlation analysis also confirmed that miR-758-5p was inversely correlated with ZBTB20 in GBM tissues. miR-758-5p suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. The restored ZBTB20 expression partially rescued the miR-758-5p-induced inhibition of GBM cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Kaplan–Meier curve analysis revealed that a high miR-758-5p expression indicated an enhanced prognosis of patients with GBM. Conclusion: miR-758-5p suppressed GBM progression by targeting ZBTB20. The miR-758-5p/ZBTB20 axis might be a promising therapeutic target for GBM treatment.</jats:p>

These signaling pathways become activated when the ligands from the stroma bind to their receptors on malignant cells. The bulk of evidence has existed in support of the fact that  TGF-β/SMAD ,  Notch ,  PI3K/Akt ,  Wnt/β-catenin ,  MEK/ERK , and  JAK/STAT  signaling pathways have a mandatory role in inducing EMT-activating TF expression, in particular  SNAIL ,  ZEB , and  TWIST , which were shown to be able to activate and prohibit the expression of mesenchymal state-associated genes and epithelial state-associated genes, respectively ( 224 ).

10.1139/bcb-2018-0313	The long noncoding RNA HOTTIP promotes breast cancer cell migration, invasiveness, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition	B234	The lncRNA HOTTIP is frequently upregulated in human cancers, where it promotes cancer progression. By sponging miR-216a, lncRNA HOTTIP increased  BCL2  expression and chemo-resistance in SCLC ( 232 ). HOTTIP increased the expression of  PD-L1  in neutrophils, which increased the  IL6  levels and promoted the immunological evasion of ovarian carcinoma ( 233 ). HOTTIP increased breast cancer cell metastasis, invasion, and EMT ( 234 ). Wu et al. (2020) investigated the levels of HOTTIP expression in OC cell lines and clinical tissue samples. The silencing of HOTTIP inhibited ovarian cancer cell rapid growth and invasion as well as migration  in vitro , whereas the greater expression of HOTTIP increased invasion in ovarian carcinoma cells, suggesting that HOTTIP could be one of the markers for unsuitable prognosis in OC cases. In addition, HOTTIP acted as a miR-615-3p sponge, thereby increasing the expression of  SWI/SNF-associated matrix-linked actin-dependent regulator of the chromatin sub-family E member 1 ) SMARCE1 ) ( 235 ). Either the upregulation of miR-615-3p or the downregulation of  SMARCE1  could abrogate the tumor-promoting effect of HOTTIP in ovarian cancer. Moreover, HOTTIP levels were inversely correlated with miR-615-3p levels and positively correlated with  SMARCE1  expression levels in OC cells. HOTTIP knock-out mice showed slower OC xenograft tumor growth  in vivo . In conclusion, lncRNA HOTTIP modulates the miR-615-3p/ SMARCE1  pathway, thereby enhancing ovarian cancer growth and metastasis ( 235 ).	HOTTIP increased the expression of  PDL1  in neutrophils, which increased the  IL6  levels and promoted the immunological evasion of ovarian carcinoma  233 .

Breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 were transfected with shRNA (short hairpin RNA) that specifically targeting HOTTIP. We observed a remarkable decrease in migration and invasiveness in these two breast cancer cell lines after knock-down of HOTTIP by shHOTTIP. We also demonstrated that the EMT of these two breast cell lines was suppressed after HOTTIP knock-down, as evidenced by increased E-cadherin levels, and decreased levels of N-cadherin, Snail, and Twist. Moreover, HOTTIP silencing also suppressed tumor metastasis in nude mice in vivo. In addition, we found that the expression of β-catenin was significantly decreased in breast cancer cells after knock-down of HOTTIP. In a further rescue experiment using overexpression of β-catenin, the rates of cell migration, invasiveness, and EMT of HOTTIP-silenced breast cancer cells were promoted, disclosing a potential role of the Wnt–β-catenin signaling pathway in this process. Overall, we discovered the positive regulatory function of HOTTIP in the migration, invasiveness, and EMT of breast cancer cells, via regulating the Wnt–β-catenin pathway. </jats:p>
10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1968	A specific role for AKT3 in the genesis of ovarian cancer through modulation of G(2)-m phase transition	B238	"Researchers observed the over-expression of lncRNA EMX2OS in gastric cancer tissues compared to matched control tissue samples ( 236 ).  AKT3  has been found to promote tumor growth and invasion in seminoma, liver, and thyroid cancer ( 237 ).  AKT3  was also highly expressed in primary ovarian cancer, and silencing of  AKT3  using shRNA considerably reduced the growth of OC cells ( 238 ). Duan et al. (2020) explored the expression, cellular function, and mechanism of EMX2OS in OC. RT-qPCR was employed to assess the amounts and activity of EMX2OS in the cell lines and tissues of OC. The relationship between EMX2OS and miR-654 expression in the OC cells was investigated using luciferase and immunoprecipitation assays. Human ovarian cancer tissues were observed to have higher levels of EMX2OS. EMX2OS knock-down decreased OC cell proliferation, spheroid formation, and invasion, whereas the over-expression of EMX2OS showed the opposite effects. Furthermore, EMX2OS promoted tumor development in a human OC xenograft mouse model  in vivo . Direct binding of EMX2OS to miR-654 acted as a sponge to downregulate miR-654 and therefore upregulated  AKT3 , the target of this miRNA. Furthermore, miR-654 reduced cell proliferation, spheroid formation, and invasion, whereas restoration of  AKT3  expression counteracted the impact of miR-654 over-expression or EMX2OS silencing. Additionally, in OC cells,  PD-L1  was discovered to be a downstream molecule of  AKT3  activity. The ectopic expression of  PD-L1  in the OC cells abrogated the anti-cancer effects caused by the knock-down of EMX2OS and  AKT3  or inducing miR-654 expression. These findings suggest that the EMX2OS/miR-654/ AKT3 / PD-L1  axis promotes OC malignancy and could be a potential treatment target for this disease ( 239 ).

               <jats:p>Ovarian cancer is the major cause of death from gynecological malignancy, and there is an urgent need for new therapeutic targets. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway has been strongly implicated in the genesis of ovarian cancer. However, to identify and evaluate potential targets for therapeutic intervention, it is critical to understand the mechanism by which the PI3K/AKT pathway facilitates ovarian carcinogenesis. Here, we show that AKT3 is highly expressed in 19 of 92 primary ovarian tumors. Strikingly, purified AKT3 exhibited up to 10-fold higher specific activity than AKT1, potentially amplifying the effects of AKT3 overexpression. Consistent with this finding, AKT3 levels in a range of ovarian cancer cell lines correlated with total AKT activity and proliferation rates, implicating AKT3 as a key mediator of ovarian oncogenesis. Specific silencing of AKT3 using short hairpin RNA markedly inhibited proliferation of the two cell lines with highest AKT3 expression and total AKT activity, OVCA429 and DOV13, by slowing G2-M phase transition. These findings are consistent with AKT3 playing a key role in the genesis of at least one subset of ovarian cancers. (Cancer Res 2006; 66(24): 11718-25)</jats:p>"
10.1159/000452577	Long non-coding RNA BANCR promotes endometrial cancer cell proliferation and invasion by regulating MMP2 and MMP1	B286	lncRNA RHPN1-AS1 was found to be over-expressed in several cancer types and is considered to be a cancer promoter ( 250 ). Moreover,  mitogen-activated protein kinase  ( MAPK ) contributes to the signal transduction from the plasma membranes to the nucleus ( 285 ). The  ERK  pathway is a key type of  MAPK  involved in numerous processes in cell biology. Importantly, activating the  ERK/MAPK  pathway may result in EC progression, according to several studies ( 286 ). Zhang et al. (2021) explored the role of lncRNA RHPN1-AS1 in the development of EC as well as the associated mechanisms ( 287 ). In EC cells and tissues, RHPN1AS1 expression was measured by RT-qPCR, CCK-8, flow cytometry, scratch wound healing, and transwell assays; colony formation has been used as well to measure proliferation, clonogenicity, cell cycle, apoptosis, invasion, and, finally, migration in HEC1A and Ishikawa cells. Moreover, immuno-fluorescence and Western blotting have been used to measure the expression level of protein in Ishikawa and HEC1A cells. They found that RHPN1AS1 expression has been substantially greater in EC cells and tissues. RHPN1AS1 expression in patient samples was linked to the histological grade, FIGO stage, and lymph node metastasis. In Ishikawa and HEC1A cells, silencing of RHPN1AS1 not only inhibited proliferation, cell cycle progression, migration, and invasion but also triggered apoptosis. Furthermore, silencing of RHPN1AS1 decreased  Bcl2  expression while increasing the expression of  caspase3  and  Bax . In addition,  MEK  and  ERK  phosphorylation was substantially reduced when RHPN1AS1 was knocked down. The inhibitory effect of silencing RHPN1AS1 on  MEK  and  ERK  phosphorylation was further increased after pretreatment with the kinase inhibitor U0126. They concluded that RHPN1AS1 stimulated the  ERK/MAPK  pathway in EC cells to promote cancer progression while inhibiting apoptosis ( 287 ).

This study aimed to assess the potential role of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) BANCR in the pathogenesis and progression of type 1 EC. Methods: Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to confirm the expression of BANCR in type 1 EC tissue, and analyze its clinical significance. In vitro, RNA interference (siRNA) was used to investigate the biological role of BANCR in type 1 EC. Results: qRT-PCR revealed that the expression of lncRNA BANCR was higher in type 1 EC (P&lt;0.01). BANCR expression was significantly correlated with FIGO stage, pathological grade, myometrial invasion, and lymph node metastasis. The expression of BANCR was significantly correlated with that of MMP2/MMP1. In vitro, knockdown of BANCR significantly suppressed proliferation, migration, and invasion of Ishikawa and HEC-1A cells, and significantly inhibited the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway that decreased MMP2 and MMP1 expression. Conclusion: BANCR is highly expressed in type 1 EC tissue and promotes EC-cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by activating ERK/MAPK signaling pathway that regulates MMP2/MMP1 expression. BANCR is expected to become a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in type 1 EC.</jats:p>

10.18388/abp.2016_1350	Biological functions of natural antisense transcripts	B300	"lncRNA HOTAIRM1 was observed to be expressed in myeloid cells, the exact location of which was later found to be on human chromosome 7p15.2 ( 297 ). In fact, HOTAIRM1 controls the expansion of the cell cycle during the maturation of myeloid precursor cells and is upregulated in NB4 human promyelocytic leukemia cells as well as in myeloid leukemia patients ( 298 ). HOTAIRM1 is also involved in the progression of several other cancers, such as breast cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and glioma ( 299 ). Anti-sense lncRNAs are transcribed from the opposite strand of genes, encoding proteins or are non-protein coding, and are strongly linked to tumor progression ( 300 ). Moreover, HOTAIRM1 is situated at the 5′ end of  homeobox A  ( HOXA ) gene cluster in an anti-sense manner and contains a similar CpG island as the  HOXA1  starting point ( 297 ). HOTAIRM1 has been shown to increase  HOXA1  expression in myeloid-derived lung cancer suppressor cells and in glioblastoma multiforme ( 301 ).  HOXA1  is a member of the HOX gene family, which is composed of four gene clusters ( HOXA ,  HOXB ,  HOXC , and  HOXD)  that play important roles in regulating embryonic development and cell differentiation.  HOXA1  is highly expressed in several types of cancer, including breast cancer, oral squamous cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and gastric cancer, and is associated with a poor prognosis. Studies have shown that HOXA1 plays a key role in regulating the cell cycle, promoting EMT, and enhancing tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. As such, HOXA1 is considered to be a cancer-promoting gene ( 302 ). Li et al. (2019) explored whether HOTAIRM1 and the respective sense transcript  HOXA  were involved in carcinogenesis and expansion of type I EC. They applied Western blotting and qRT-PCR to determine  HOXA1  and HOTAIRM1 expression levels in the type I EC tissues. Additionally,  in vitro  and  in vivo , gain-and-loss-of-function studies have been performed to examine the biological roles of  HOXA1  and HOTAIRM1 in type I EC. Type I EC tissues were found to have considerably higher levels of HOTAIRM1 and  HOXA1 . Moreover, HOTAIRM1 and  HOXA1  expression was shown to be linked to lymph node metastasis, FIGO stage, and also with each other. Proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT were dramatically reduced when HOTAIRM1 was knocked down, and the opposite effects were seen when HOTAIRM1 was upregulated. Furthermore, they discovered that HOTAIRM1 affected  HOXA1  gene expression in type I EC cells. Furthermore,  HOXA1  knockdown inhibited cancer progression, thereby confirming  HOXA1  to be an oncogene. Moreover, the involvement of  HOXA1  and HOTAIRM1 in promoting tumor development  in vivo  was validated. They showed for the first time that HOTAIRM1 regulated  HOXA1  in the type I EC by acting as the oncogene. The HOTAIRM1 /HOXA1  axis may not only be a predictive biomarker but also a therapeutic target in type I EC ( 303 ).

The true biological significance of the natural antisense transcripts remains controversial despite many years of research.

10.1111/febs.13502	MiR-124 exerts tumor suppressive functions on the cell proliferation, motility and angiogenesis of bladder cancer by fine-tuning UHRF1	B318	The lncRNA nuclear-rich transcript 1 (lncRNA-NEAT1) stimulates the proliferation and invasion of CC cells while inhibiting apoptosis ( 317 ). One study investigated the putative mechanisms of lncRNA-NEAT1 in CC. Prior investigations have found a major contribution of miR-124 to various types of cancer ( 318 ). Therefore it was hypothesized that lncRNAs could influence tumor growth by functioning as a molecular sponge for miR-124, thus regulating the expression of target mRNAs ( 319 ). The contribution of lncRNA-NEAT1 and its sponging of miR-124 to CC progression, as well as the associated mechanisms, was examined by Shen et al. (2020). They investigated the relationship between lncRNA-NEAT1 expression with CC patient clinical features. In addition, researchers measured migration and invasion using transwell and scratch wound healing assays. In addition, anchorage-independent colony formation assays and CCK-8 have been used to measure cell growth. TargetScan, RNA pull-down assays, and, finally, dual-luciferase reporter gene served to predict and validate the binding of miR-124 to lncRNA-NEAT1. Moreover, researchers applied Western blotting to measure  MMP-2 ,  MMP-9 , and  NF-κB  pathway-associated factors and EMT-related factors ( vimentin ,  E-cadherin , and  N-cadherin ). The lncRNA-NEAT1 expression elevated in the CC tissues and cells with a positive correlation to lymph node metastasis and TNM stage in the patients. When lncRNA-NEAT1 was over-expressed in SiHa or HeLa cells, proliferation, migration, invasion, and the  NF-κB  pathway were enhanced, and the EMT markers were altered. The opposite effects were observed when lncRNA-NEAT1 was knocked out. Furthermore, the impact of lncRNA NEAT1 on HeLa cell motility, EMT, invasion, and the  NF-κB  pathway was abrogated by the administration of miR-124. They concluded that lncRNA-NEAT1 modulated the miR-124 /NF-κB  pathway, thereby promoting CC cell invasion and dissemination ( 320 ).	One study investigated the putative mechanisms of lncRNANEAT1 in CC.

10.1002/ijc.28774	miR-145 sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to paclitaxel by targeting Sp1 and Cdk6	B387	The circRNA vacuolar protein sorting 13 homolog C (circVPS13C) has been found to be upregulated in ovarian cancer ( 386 ). However, the cellular mechanisms by which circVPS13C promotes ovarian cancer were unclear. In one study, miR-145 influenced  Sp1  and  Cdk6  levels to increase paclitaxel sensitivity in ovarian cancer cells ( 387 ). Nevertheless, the mechanism by which propofol could mediate miR-145 suppression of ovarian cancer cells was still unclear. Lu et al. (2021) reported that cell cycle, survival, and metastasis of ovarian cancer cells were inhibited, while apoptosis was increased, after propofol administration ( 388 ). It was discovered that propofol affected CircVPS13C and miR-145 to act against OC. MTT and transwell assays have been used to measure the survival and metastasis of ovarian cancer cells. Flow cytometry has been employed for studying apoptosis and the cell cycle. In addition, miR-145 and circVPS13C expression levels were measured using RT-qPCR. Moreover, the circinteractome database predicted a target binding between miR-145 and circVPS13C, which was later confirmed using RNA pull-down assay and dual-luciferase reporter assay as well as RNA-binding protein immuno-precipitation (RIP). In addition, the levels of  ERK , p- ERK ,  MEK , and p- MEK  in the OC cells were determined using Western blotting. Treatment with propofol reduced the survival, migration, and cell cycle of the OC cells while increasing apoptosis. The miR-145 levels were dose-dependently increased by propofol, which explained its anti-cancer activity. circVPS13C also directly targeted miR-145. Propofol inhibited ovarian cancer development by decreasing circVPS13C, leading to an increase in miR-145. In conclusion, propofol affected the circVPS13C/miR-145/ MEK / ERK  signaling pathways for inhibiting malignant properties and upregulating apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells ( 388 ).	However, the cellular mechanisms by which circVPS13C promotes ovarian cancer were unclear.

In our study, paclitaxel‐resistant ovarian cancer patients and cell lines had decreased miR‐145 levels and expressed high levels of Sp1 and Cdk6. Introducing miR‐145 into SKOV3/PTX and A2780/PTX cells led to a reduction in Cdk6 and Sp1 along with downregulation of P‐gp and pRb. These changes resulted in increased accumulation of antineoplastic drugs and G1 cell cycle arrest, which rendered the cells more sensitive to paclitaxel <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>. These effects could be reversed by reintroducing Sp1 or Cdk6 into cells expressing high levels of miR‐145, resulting in restoration of P‐gp and pRb levels. Furthermore, we confirmed that both Cdk6 and Sp1 are targets of miR‐145. Intriguingly, demethylation with 5‐aza‐dC led to reactivation of miR‐145 expression in drug‐resistant ovarian cancer cell lines, which also resulted in increased sensitivity to paclitaxel. Collectively, these findings begin to elucidate the role of miR‐145 as an important regulator of chemoresistance in ovarian cancer by controlling both Cdk6 and Sp1.</jats:p>

In their study, RT-qPCR has been employed to measure the hsa-circ0013958 level in 45 pairs of matched OC cells and tissues, and the clinicopathological relevance and diagnostic value were determined. CCK-8 test and transwell assay as well as flow cytometry have been employed to measure the migration, proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis of OVCAR3 and A2780 cells. Western blotting was used to measure the apoptosis-associated proteins Bcl2 and Bax and the EMT-associated proteins E-cadherin and vimentin. hsa-circ0013958 was found to have an abundant expression in OC tissues and cells, with an association to the patient’s lymph node metastasis and FIGO stage. The  in vitro  knock-down of hsa-circ0013958 suppressed OC proliferation or rapid growth, migration, and invasion and increased apoptosis.

10.1002/iub.1753	MicroRNA-1270 is associated with poor prognosis and its inhibition yielded anticancer mechanisms in human osteosarcoma	B424	miR-1270 enhanced the proliferation and metastasis of osteosarcoma cells, and over-expression of miR-1270 was linked to poor survival in osteosarcoma patients ( 424 ). CircCdr1 has been shown to inhibit miR-1270 expression and promote SCAI expression, thereby enhancing cisplatin sensitivity in ovarian cancer ( 425 ). The transcription factor ZEB2 ( 426 ) has several roles in both pathological and physiological processes, such as neurological development and preservation of macrophage tissue specificity, and also in carcinogenesis ( 427 ). ZEB2 upregulates MMP activity and reduces E-cadherin epithelial marker and intercellular adhesion, thus facilitating tumor cell invasion ( 428 ). ZEB2 was found to be abundantly expressed in CC cells, where it promoted EMT and metastasis ( 429 ). Wang et al. (2021) found significantly higher expressions of circ0001247 in the CC cells and tissues. circ0001247 could regulate the miR-1270/ZEB2 axis to promote CC cell proliferation and dissemination as well as invasion while also inhibiting apoptosis. In addition, circRNA expression in the CC and normal cervical cell lines was obtained from GEO database ( GSE147483  dataset), and circ0001247 was found to be the most distinct circRNA. RT-qPCR has been employed to measure miR-1270 and ZEB2 expression  in vitro  and  in vivo . In addition, the binding of circ0001247 to miR-1270, as well as the binding of miR-1270 to 3′UTR of ZEB2, was confirmed using dual-luciferase reporter gene assays.  GSE147483  analysis showed that circ0001247 could function as an oncogenic circRNA in CC. circ0001247 expression in the CC cell lines and tissues has been greater in comparison to the healthy cervical epithelial cells and surrounding normal tissue. Silencing of circ0001247, as well as over-expression of miR-1270, promoted proliferation and metastasis while inhibiting apoptosis in CC cells. Furthermore, circ0001247 was found to sponge miR-1270 and increase ZEB2 expression to accelerate CC development ( 430 ).	miR-1270 enhanced the proliferation and metastasis of osteosarcoma cells, and over-expression of miR-1270 was linked to poor survival in osteosarcoma patients ( 424 ).	10.3389/fonc.2023.1215194		<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In this work, we explored the aberrant expression pattern, clinical association, and functional regulations of microRNA‐1270 (miR‐1270) in osteosarcoma.

CircCdr1 has been shown to inhibit miR-1270 expression and promote SCAI expression, thereby enhancing cisplatin sensitivity in ovarian cancer ( 425 ). The transcription factor ZEB2 ( 426 ) has several roles in both pathological and physiological processes, such as neurological development and preservation of macrophage tissue specificity, and also in carcinogenesis ( 427 ). ZEB2 upregulates MMP activity and reduces E-cadherin epithelial marker and intercellular adhesion, thus facilitating tumor cell invasion ( 428 ). ZEB2 was found to be abundantly expressed in CC cells, where it promoted EMT and metastasis ( 429 ). Wang et al. (2021) found significantly higher expressions of circ0001247 in the CC cells and tissues. circ0001247 could regulate the miR-1270/ZEB2 axis to promote CC cell proliferation and dissemination as well as invasion while also inhibiting apoptosis. In addition, circRNA expression in the CC and normal cervical cell lines was obtained from GEO database ( GSE147483  dataset), and circ0001247 was found to be the most distinct circRNA. RT-qPCR has been employed to measure miR-1270 and ZEB2 expression  in vitro  and  in vivo . In addition, the binding of circ0001247 to miR-1270, as well as the binding of miR-1270 to 3′UTR of ZEB2, was confirmed using dual-luciferase reporter gene assays.

Zinc finger E‐box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) induces EMT by upregulating matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), yet <jats:italic>MMP</jats:italic> genes lack ZEB2 binding motif in their promoters. Recently, expression of MMPs was associated to the activation of ETS1 transcription factor; however, a link between ZEB2 and ETS proto‐oncogene 1, transcription factor (ETS1) remains to be elucidated. Hence, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of <jats:italic>ETS1</jats:italic> by ZEB2 after our initial observation that ZEB2 and ETS1 are coexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCCs). Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays clearly showed that ZEB2 binds to E‐box sequences on the promoter of <jats:italic>ETS1</jats:italic>. Elevated expression of ETS1 was found in DLD‐ZEB2 and A431‐ZEB2 inducible systems, and knockdown of ZEB2 caused an explicit downregulation of ETS1 in shZEB2‐SNU398 and shZEB2‐SK‐HEP‐1 cells. Repression of ETS1 expression in ZEB2‐induced conditions substantially impaired the migration and invasive capacities of DLD1 cells. Mechanistically, knockdown of ETS1 in ZEB2‐expressing cells resulted in the downregulation of established ZEB2 targets TWIST and MMP9. Correlation analyses in HCC lines, cancer complementary DNA arrays, and The Cancer Genome Atlas RNA‐sequencing data set revealed that <jats:italic>ZEB2</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>ETS1</jats:italic> are coexpressed, and their expressions in human tumors show a highly significant positive correlation. Our results demonstrated that ZEB2 acts as an upstream regulator of ETS1 and, in turn, ETS1 maintains ZEB2‐induced EMT. These findings add another level of complexity to the understanding of ZEB2 in the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells, and put ZEB2/ETS1 axis as a novel therapeutic target in human malignancies.</jats:p>

               <jats:p>SND1 is an AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC-binding protein that is upregulated in numerous human cancers, where it has been assigned multiple functional roles. In this study, we report its association with the TGFβ1 signaling pathway, which promotes epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast cancer. SND1 was upregulated in breast cancer tissues, in particular in primary invasive ductal carcinomas. Transcriptional activation of the SND1 gene was controlled by the TGFβ1/Smad pathway, specifically by activation of the Smad2/Smad3 complex. The SND1 promoter region contained several Smad-specific recognition domains (RD motifs), which were recognized and bound by the Smad complex that enhanced the transcriptional activation of SND1. We found that SND1 promoted expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1, leading to RhoA ubiquitination and degradation. RhoA degradation in breast cancer cells disrupted F-actin cytoskeletal organization, reduced cell adhesion, increased cell migration and invasion, and promoted metastasis. Overall, our results define a novel role for SND1 in regulating breast tumorigenesis and metastasis. Cancer Res; 75(7); 1275–86. ©2015 AACR.</jats:p>"

Particularly in cancer, circRNAs have been reported to be widely involved in the physiological/pathological process of life. However, it is unclear whether circRNAs are specifically involved in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Methods: We investigated the expression profile of circRNAs in six PDAC cancer samples and paired adjacent normal tissues using microarray. A high-throughput circRNA microarray was used to identify dysregulated circular RNAs in six PDAC patients. Bioinformatic analyses were applied to study these differentially expressed circRNAs. Furthermore, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to confirm these results. Results: We revealed and confirmed that a number of circRNAs were dysregulated, which suggests a potential role in pancreatic cancer. Conclusions: this study demonstrates that clusters of circRNAs are aberrantly expressed in PDAC compared with normal samples and provides new potential targets for the future treatment of PDAC and novel insights into PDAC biology.</jats:p>
10.1159/000460505	MicroRNA-218 increases the sensitivity of bladder cancer to cisplatin by targeting Glut1	B442	The targeting of  APC  regulators of the  Wnt  signaling pathway by miR-218 was discovered to inhibit CC cell progression ( 441 ). miR-218 has been shown to inhibit several cancers such as ovarian, bladder, and prostate ( 442 ).  HOXA1  is considered to be an oncogene that promotes proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. The upregulation of  HOXA1  has been linked to worse survival rates in CC patients ( 443 ). Mao et al. (2019) discovered that CC cell lines and tissues had substantially higher levels of circEIF4G2. In addition, higher circEIF4G2 levels were linked to a worse outcome in CC patients. Moreover, rapid growth of cells, colony formation, and invasion as well as migration were all reduced when circEIF4G2 was knocked down in CC cells. circEIF4G2 was also discovered to act as a sponge for miR 218, which, in turn, was known to target  HOXA1  mRNA. Therefore, circEIF4G2 could sponge miR-218 to increase the expression levels of  HOXA1 . Transfection with a miR-218 inhibitor abrogated the inhibitory impact of circEIF4G2 knockdown on cell invasion, proliferation, and migration, according to rescue studies. Moreover, the impact of the miR-218 inhibitor on CC cells was also reversed when  HOXA1  was silenced. Hence, circEIF4G2 boosted cell proliferation and migration through the miR-218/ HOXA1  pathway ( 444 ).	The targeting of  APC  regulators of the  Wnt  signaling pathway by miR-218 was discovered to inhibit CC cell progression ( 441 ). miR-218 has been shown to inhibit several cancers such as ovarian, bladder, and prostate ( 442 ).	10.3389/fonc.2023.1215194		<jats:p>Background/Aims: MicroRNA-218 (miR-218) is down-regulated in many malignancies that have been implicated in the regulation of diverse processes in cancer cells. However, the involvement of miR-218 in chemo-sensitivity to cisplatin and the precise mechanism of this action remained unknown in bladder cancer. Methods: qRT-PCR was used to detect miR-218 and its target Glut1 expression in bladder cancer cell lines T24 and EJ. CCK-8 method was utilized to measure the cell viability. IC 50 was calculated via a probit regression model. Glut1 was detected by western blotting for analysis of potential mechanism. Luciferase reporter assay was utilized to validate Glut1 as a direct target gene of miR-218. The intracellular level of GSH and ROS were determined using a commercial colorimetric assay kit and 2’, 7’-dichlorodihydro-fluorescein diacetate, respectively. Results: Over-expression of miR-218 significantly reduced the rate of glucose uptake and total level of GSH and enhanced the chemo-sensitivity of bladder cancer to cisplatin. Mechanistically, Glut1 was found to be a direct and functional target of miR-218. Up-regulation of Glut1 could restore chemo-resistance in T24 and EJ cells. On the contrary, knockdown of Glut1 could generate a similar effect as up-regulating the expression of miR-218. Conclusions: MiR-218 increases the sensitivity of bladder cancer to cisplatin by targeting Glut1. Restoration of miR-218 and repression of glut1 may provide a potential strategy to restore chemo-sensitivity in bladder cancer.</jats:p>
