B25-animals-12-01546	Inbreeding is known to negatively affects the reproductive performance of male animals [ 21 ], and when expressed at high levels can cause poor semen quality [ 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 ]. However, not all inbreeding reported is harmful; the authors of [ 26 ] reported that recent inbreeding is more harmful than ancient inbreeding due to selection decreasing the frequency of deleterious alleles over time. Many studies have explored the genome wide distribution of ROH and inbreeding depression in cattle populations [ 9 , 27 , 28 ] using high density Illumina BovineHD BeadChip microarrays. This includes studies such as [ 29 ], whose findings showed that ROH are frequent across all breeds (Angus, Belgian Blue, Charolais, Friesian, Hereford, Holstein, Holstein-Friesian, Limousin, and Simmental); however, difference in patterns of ROH and variation is based on breed origin and recent management. The authors of [ 10 ] reported the distinct differences in length, quantity, and frequency of ROH between breeds and levels of genomic inbreeding. The study highlighted higher levels of inbreeding observed in commercial breeds, especially beef breeds and identified a number of genes confirmed to influence production traits [ 10 ]. Homozygous regions of the genome [ 8 ] have been reported in different species, not only in cattle [ 19 , 30 ], but these regions have been used to quantify individual inbreeding in humans [ 18 ], goats [ 31 ], buffalo [ 32 ], sheep [ 33 ], and pigs [ 12 ]; based on results of ROH in these studies, it appears to be more accurate than traditional pedigree-based estimates [ 13 ]. In this study, more than 1000 Mb ROH were estimated in six selected Chinese and South African beef cattle breeds at a genomic length of 2.6 Gb, with the highest ROH observed in the NGU, ANG, BEL, CSI, SIM, and BON breeds. Furthermore, the highest ROH were observed between classes 0–5 Mb compared to the rest of the classes (5–10 Mb, 10–20 Mb and 20–40 Mb) with no ROH observed in >40 class. Similar results were reported by [ 29 ], who compared European cattle breeds to the European bison, with average ROH observed for Angus and Hereford, and the most ROH were observed for the European bison breeds between classes 1–5 Mb, suggesting limited recent inbreeding for Angus and Hereford, but reporting high levels of inbreeding for European bison. These results confirm earlier studies that reported population history involving a severe bottleneck [ 29 ]. Runs of homozygosity can be affected by demographic events [ 34 ], e.g., age, geography, breed history and origin, area of distribution, climate, introduction of breeds, environment, production system, etc.; the fact that breeds from this study are distributed in two geographically different environments might explain the inbreeding. The authors of [ 35 ] reported that inbred individuals are particularly sensitive to environment changes this can explaining most of the breeds in the study are inbred due to moving from one captive environment to another captive environment. Analysis at a genomic level revealed significant distribution of ROH within the selected six Chinese and South African beef cattle breeds. Chinese CSI and BEL had significant ROH observed on chromosomes 5, 6, 11, and 14 for both breeds. South Africa BON showed the highest ROH on chromosomes 5, 7, and 14, and SIM displayed the most ROH on chromosomes 5, 6, and 14. The highest genome coverage in ROH observed for ANG on chromosomes 1–6, 11, and 14, and NGU on chromosomes 1–3, 5–7, 11, and 14. The study further used length and number of ROH to identify SNPs in those ROH. The authors of [ 30 ] reported that greatest number of ROH per chromosomes was observed for chromosome 1 across all 867 animals, and ROH per chromosome tended to decrease with chromosome length. By identifying the number of SNPs in ROH, the study identified overlapping ROH that were above the threshold of 0.05. Chromosome 14 had the most SNPs above the threshold; still, it did not report any QTL or association to any candidate gene in all breeds. Additionally, no SNP in ROH were identified for NGU; possibly markers were standardized for commercial breeds, e.g., (Simentaler) however Nguni is an indigenous Southern African breed. In total, we reported 13 genomic regions that were associated to nine candidate genes ( CDF9 ,  MARCH1 ,  WDR19 ,  SLOICI ,  ST7 ,  DOP1B ,  CFAF9 ,  INHBA , and  ADAMTS1 ). The authors of [ 36 ] reported that genomic regions located on  BTA 7, BTA 14, BTA 16,  and  BTA 18  were characterized by a high frequency of ROH occurrence and included important genes related to immune traits, muscularity, and ease of calving. The authors of [ 10 ] reported a similar region,  BTA 6 , was identified for Polish Red, Limousin, and Simmental breeds.  MARCH1  [ 19 ] revealed an association with QTL for sperm motility and semen volume on  BTA 6  in SIM. The  MARCH 1  gene was also reported by [ 37 ] to be significantly associated with semen production traits (semen volume per ejaculate, number of sperm per ejaculate, and number of motile sperm per ejaculate). Another gene associated with QTL for sperm motility revealed on  BTA 5  is  SLCO1C1  [ 17 ] for BON and BEL.  BTA 7  revealed the growth differentiation GDF9 gene was associated with QTL for sperm motility, sperm count, and sperm integrity. This was also reported by [ 38 ] who revealed significant association of  GDF9  with sperm quality traits in Holstein bulls. The results also stated that  GDF9  is involved in the initiation or maintenance of spermatogenesis; however, further verification is needed. WD repeat domain 19 ( WDR 19 ) gene was detected on  BTA 5  and  BTA 6  for CSI showed an association to QTL sperm motility, sperm head abnormalities, and sperm tail abnormalities; this gene was reported to be associated to ejaculate volume, sperm concentration, sperm motility, and sperm head and tail anomalies [ 39 ]. On  BTA 4 ,  ST7  gene was significant to QTLs for sperm count and sperm motility, this gene was also reported by [ 40 ] as the nearest genes for poor sperm motility. QTL associated with semen traits were identified and validated by previously published literature. This study highlighted genes within QTL regions of semen for beef bulls. Identification of the QTL regions associated with these traits provides the knowledge necessary to enrich these regions [ 35 ]. The authors of [ 41 ] reported on three QTL found to be related with abnormal sperm frequencies at a significant  p  < 0.01. The authors of [ 40 ] reported several candidate genes associated with sperm concentration, sperm motility and sperm volume in Holstein-Friesian populations.	Inbreeding is known to negatively affects the reproductive performance of male animals [ 21 ], and when expressed at high levels can cause poor semen quality [ 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 ].	Male moths compete to arrive first at a female releasing pheromone. A new study reveals that additional pheromone cues released only by younger females may prompt males to avoid them in favor of older but more fecund females.	10.3390/ani12121546	9219517	Unrelated

Early after  in vitro  infection, Leishmania-infected macrophages upregulate the transcription of numerous glycolytic genes (e.g. hexokin pyruvate kinase isozymes M2, lactate dehydrogenase A), which correlates with intracellular parasite survival ( 83 – 86 ). Infected macrophages were reported to have less intracellular amastigotes when glycolysis was inhibited with 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) ( 86 ). In addition, Leishmania infection reduces the sensitivity of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization to apoptotic stimuli, implying a relationship between mitochondria and parasite persistence ( 82 ). Overall, glycolysis was found to be crucial in the early stages of Leishmania spp. infection in macrophages and neutrophils, whereas enhanced mitochondrial metabolism was revealed to be important in the late stages of infection ( 87 ,  88 ).

This unfolding causes the disruption of the tertiary structure of the protein, revealing the cryptic sites for various ligand binding, molecule activation or domain cleavage by proteases ( 52 ). In addition to its role as an integrin activator, Talin-1 also functions as a mechanosensor responsible for the transmission of tension between the actomyosin machinery and the ECM, within the FA ( 11 ). To perform its role as a mechanosensor, Talin-1 requires at least two anchorage points: ECM-anchored integrins and actin (the cytoskeleton). Talin-1 head domain binds to the integrin cytosolic tail with its tail binding to the actin, thus connecting integrins with the cytoskeleton ( 53 ). This bridging position allows Talin-1 to be folded and unfolded either by mechanical forces generated from the outside or internally by cytoskeletal contraction. Talin-1 participates in both 'inside-out' and 'outside-in' signaling, and is capable of transmitting mechanical forces imposed on cells externally, or generated internally ( 45 , 53 - 56 ). Through its binding to the cytoplasmic tail of integrin β subunits, Talin-1 controls integrin activation, linking the integrin β subunit to the actin bundles rod through by the C-terminal rod ( 14 ). The bridging position of the Talin-1 molecule leads to its unfolding and stretching due to the actomyosin contraction, and these conformation changes affect the affinity and interaction with its binding partners ( 57 ). Talin-1 is required for the initial weak connection between small clusters of integrins and the cytoskeleton ( 58 ), and for the reinforcement of integrin linkages to the cytoskeleton when cells encounter mechanical forces, again suggesting the role of Talin-1 in FA formation ( 42 , 59 ). Thus, similar to the activation and inactivation of integrins, the activation and inhibition of Talin-1 has been reported to play a crucial role in the regulation of FA dynamics and the transduction of mechanical signals.	The bridging position of the Talin-1 molecule leads to its unfolding and stretching due to the actomyosin contraction, and these conformation changes affect the affinity and interaction with its binding partners ( 57 ).

Therefore, the distribution of spike protein secondary structures was analyzed in order to establish the effect of the best COF on the deformation of the spike protein folding. The fact is that the suitable condition of the interaction between the spike protein and ACE2 receptor occurs in the case of increasing the β-sheets and α-helices, and decreasing the coils, bends, and turns [ 42 , 43 ].  Fig. 3 c shows the secondary structures of the spike protein both with and without the company of COFs. As is clear, the presence of COFs increased coils, bends, and turns, as well as reduced the β-sheets and α-helices. COFs were shown to have positive performance in deforming the spike protein, in which a reduction of the spike protein interactions with the ACES2 receptor resulted. Moreover, the findings declared that COF-78 was the most potent ligand among the other selected molecules for changing the folding of the spike protein motif as the increase in coil, bend, and turn structures had been the highest in the protein simulation. Furthermore, investigating the number of hydrogen bonds, as well as the energy of interaction, proved instability of the spike protein secondary structure.

B76-ijms-21-07287	Some miRNAs have been shown to modulate multidrug resistance in many tumor cells, including PAs. For instance, Wu et al. identified that miR-93 was significantly upregulated in bromocriptine-resistant prolactinomas [ 75 ]. In addition, the silencing of mir-93 significantly increased the sensitivity of MMQ cells to dopamine agonist treatment. Their miRNA–mRNA network analysis predicted that miR-93 could potentially regulate p21 expression. In another study, Hu et al. confirmed that miR-93-5p could enhance the drug resistance of prolactinoma cells by regulation of TGF-β1/Smad3-dependent fibrosis [ 76 ]. Jian et al. explored the relationship between miR-145-5p expression as well as bromocriptine sensitivity both in vitro and in vivo [ 77 ]. They demonstrated that miR-145-5p was decreased in bromocriptine-resistant prolactinoma tissues; the downregulation of miR-145-5p was correlated with the upregulation of translationally controlled tumor protein (TPT1) in this study. Taken together, this study suggested that miR-145-5p affected the sensitivity of prolactinoma to bromocriptine by directly binding to the 3′-UTR of TPT1. miR-145-5p might be a promising candidate target to develop a novel therapeutic strategy to overcome the bromocriptine resistance of prolactinoma.

Especially in ruthenium–arene complexes, an important interaction is between π-electrons of aromatic rings and the Ru cationic sites with high oxidation states. 89,90  This kind interaction leads to both immobilization and reduction of Ru species. In the present study, we used potassium perruthenate with the oxidation state of +7 for Ru. However, the XPS analysis showed that the oxidation state of supported Ru is +4 in the designed nanocomposite. This is an evidence of successful immobilization of ruthenium species on the organosilica shell that can be achieved  via  coordination of aromatic π-electrons with the Ru-centers followed by the reduction of the oxidation state of Ru from +7 to +4.

Mirzaei et al. [ 55 ] utilized Timoshenko beam theory and the Ritz technique with polynomial basis functions to explore the nonlinear free vibration of CNTRC sandwiches. Zhu et al. [ 56 ] assessed nanocomposite plates reinforced with straight CNTs under static and free vibration conditions using the first-order shear deformation theory. Additionally, Mehar et al. [ 57 ] examined the free vibration behavior of FG-CNTRCs in a thermally active environment.	Therefore, the use of the first-order shear deformation theory (e.g., Timoshenko theory) and higher-order shear deformation theories is recommended [ [49] ,  [50] ,  [51] ,  [52] ,  [53] ,  [54] ].	Firearm violence remains a significant problem in the US (with 2787 adolescents killed in 2015). However, the research on school firearm violence prevention practices and policies is scant. Parents are major stakeholders in relation to firearm violence by youths and school safety in general. The purpose of this study was to examine what parents thought schools should be doing to reduce the risk of firearm violence in schools. A valid and Related questionnaire was mailed to a national random sample of 600 parents who had at least one child enrolled in a public secondary school (response rate = 47%). Parents perceived inadequate parental monitoring/rearing practices (73%), peer harassment and/or bullying (58%), inadequate mental health care services for youth (54%), and easy access to guns (51%) as major causes of firearm violence in schools. The school policies perceived to be most effective in reducing firearm violence were installing an alert system in schools (70%), working with law enforcement to design an emergency response plan (70%), creating a comprehensive security plan (68%), requiring criminal background checks for all school personnel prior to hiring (67%), and implementing an anonymous system for students to report peer concerns regarding potential violence (67%). Parents seem to have a limited grasp of potentially effective interventions to reduce firearm violence.	10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e28388	11024553	Unrelated

B146-pharmaceuticals-15-01228	The complexity of the legal boundaries surrounding cannabis has been recognised as a major factor that has hindered the development of effective CB research [ 146 ]. Due to the difficulty of complying with these regulations’ legal requirements, researchers and funding organisations may be less inclined to examine innovative products. It is anticipated that the research community will begin to invest in the development of new and improved methods for delivering CBDs as a result of the increasing acceptability of CBDs in the US and other nations. One of these methods includes developing transdermal and topical delivery systems. Therefore, the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health has expressed interest in financing research into the study of CBDs [ 147 ]. Pharmaceutical companies or other research institutions may start a similar programme in the following years with an emphasis on the evaluation and development of topical or transdermal drug delivery system (TDDS) for CB usage, given the numerous benefits of this approach [ 148 , 149 ].

B26-micromachines-12-01480	The physicochemical properties of silver nanoparticles are largely determined by the synthesis conditions: temperature, reaction time, pH, molar ratio of reagents, order of addition of salts and reducing agents, speed and type of stirring, etc. [ 18 ]. For example, the AgNPs with a size of 18 ± 4 nm were synthesized at a temperature of 120 °C and a heating rate of 7.5 °C min −1  by the precursor heating method, where the main factor affecting particle size was heating rate. The using of the precursor injection method and temperature of 100 °C allowed the authors to obtain the silver nanoparticles with a size of 17 ± 2 nm [ 19 ]. At the same time the maximum synthesis of biogenic silver nanoparticles prepared with stem extract of  Cissus quadrangularis  was achieved within 1 h, at pH 8 and temperature of 70 °C [ 20 ]. In addition, to obtain small monodisperse nanomaterials, it is important that the nucleation process takes place in a short period of time [ 19 ]. Nanoparticles synthesized using adsorption interaction with resorcinol in an alkaline medium demonstrated significant differences in physical and chemical properties depending on the preparation conditions that affected the nanoparticle morphology, size and aggregation [ 21 ]. It has been shown that the production of nanoparticles of a certain shape and size can be achieved by changing the methods of synthesis, reducing agents and stabilizers [ 22 ]. The Kundu et al. was showed that Ag nanochains formation was raised by low TX-100 concentrations and high pH [ 23 ]. The reduction of silver particles occurs, as a rule, in the presence of stabilizers, which play an essential role in determining the particle size and shape, as well as ensuring their stability [ 24 ]. Recently, various types of surfactants have begun to be used as stabilizing agents in the synthesis of AgNPs to increase their stability, such as sugars [ 25 ], trisodium citrate [ 26 ], lignosulfates [ 27 ], ascorbic acid [ 28 ], plant extracts [ 29 ] etc. Cationic surfactants have a powerful stabilizing effect on AgNP by binding to the surface of silver nanoparticles through chemisorption. For example, it has been shown that the stabilization of silver nanoparticles with DTAB (dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide), TTAB (tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide) and CTAB (hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide) is very effective, and the stabilizing effect is increased by increasing the length of hydrophobic substituents on the polar ammonium head, which results in the formation of small sized nanoparticles with high positive zeta potential values [ 30 ]. Moreover, some nonionic surfactants or leaf extract can act not only as stabilizers, but also as reducing agents [ 29 , 31 ]. For example, the use of the surfactant Tween 80 is described for the synthesis and self-assembly of stable water-soluble silver nanoparticles, which acted simultaneously as a reducing agent and a stabilizer, which is certainly more environmentally friendly. In addition, this method provides a high concentration of silver colloids and can be applied in industrial production [ 32 ]. In the study of Behravan et al. the influence of AgNO 3  concentration, extract concentration of  Berberis vulgaris  and reaction incubation time were identified for the biosynthesis of AgNPs [ 18 ].

R5	The mechanical movement of bones depends on their shape and size, the space between the bones, and their structural organization and natural properties. The femur bone is the longest and strongest bone in the body, and fractures of the femoral trunk indicate severe trauma.[ 1 ] These fractures are more common in women than men, which is probably because of the wider pelvic area in women and a greater probability of occurrence of coxa vara.[ 2 ] Another factor could be osteoporosis, one of the most important health issues in women and the most common metabolic bone disease, whose prevalence is increasing worldwide.[ 3 ] The prevalence of this disease is related to age and gender, and it is most common in women of menopausal age. Because of the increase in life expectancy and in the number of elderly people, it is expected that the prevalence of this disease will increase significantly in the coming decades.[ 4 ] Today, bone mass density measurements form the basis for a diagnosis of osteoporosis. The size of the studied area is an important factor in the measurement of bone density, and any errors in the measurement of area interfere with the measurement of bone mineral density (BMD).[ 5 ] A decreased T-score is considered to be a criterion for diagnosing osteoporotic disorders and is related to the so-called fracture threshold.[ 6 ] Eighty percent of fractures have a close relationship with BMD reduction. Because BMD is obtained by dividing bone mineral content by area, accurate measurement of area or the surface of the studied area is important.[ 7 ] Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation of area of the hip and forearm with the gender and height of individuals in the normal population and also to compare the BMD in the forearm and hip regions with regard to distribution of cortical bone.

10.1371/journal.pone.0090972	Protease inhibitors from marine actinobacteria as a potential source for antimalarial compound	B44-antibiotics-09-00372	In a developing word with scarce resources, poor sanitation and food safety issues, loose rules and regulations, overcrowding and poverty, the economic drivers of inappropriate socio-ecological behaviors are one of the leading cause of antibiotic resistance (ABR) [ 37 , 38 , 39 ]. A study conducted in Madagascar have shown that the high socio-economic status, housing quality, access to clean water and occupational status have lower risk of colonization with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae [ 40 ]. While other studies reported households sharing common habitats with livestock or poultry in rural areas in India [ 41 ] and Bangladesh respectively [ 42 ]. The combination of poverty, poor regulations and lack of knowledge is a recipe for detrimental behaviors and practices. As example, raising backyard poultry in rural areas in Bangladesh brings a good return-on-investment, however these practices are associated with low or inexistent biosecurity measures [ 43 ]. Poor sanitation and hygiene was reported in different studies after slaughtering food-animals and butchering poultry [ 43 , 44 , 45 ]. Slaughters’ and butcheries waste are released in the environment (i.e. open land and municipality water), allowing domestic and wildlife animals to scavenge on these leftovers. Untreated animal waste is used for a variety of purposes to generate income among which the application of animal manure as fertilizers [ 37 ]. Other socio-ecological behaviors include sharing surface water between humans and animals. Humans’ uses water for cleaning, fishing and bathing while animals use the same water for drinking, grazing and defecating [ 46 ]. The growing demand for animal protein [ 37 , 38 , 39 ] mainly in Asia and Africa and to a lesser extent in South America has triggered the routine use of antimicrobials to maintain animal’s health and meet the global transition for high-protein diet (i.e. meat, poultry, egg, fish), urbanization and the need to intensify animal production [ 47 ]. The poorly regulated food supply chain mainly in Africa and Southeast Asia [ 48 ] has led to the spread of resistant bacteria particularly foodborne pathogens. In Ethiopia, antibiotics are being added directly to raw milk in an attempt for the vendors of extending shelf-life of their products [ 49 ]. Food supply chain safety is a major issue especially in the absence of data to track the sources of contamination, in addition to poor or absence of regulations in the agricultural sector. Studies conducted in different countries namely Ghana [ 50 ], Nigeria [ 51 ], Senegal [ 52 ], Kenya [ 53 ] and Tanzania [ 54 ] showed high antimicrobial residues in eggs and meat compared with Europe [ 55 ], a highly controlled and regulated area. A qualitative research examined Cambodian workers [ 56 ] involved in food-chain showed that the main drivers of inadequate farmers practices are related to poor control systems, unlimited access to antibiotics and strong belief about the necessity of antibiotics for animal raising due to lack of knowledge about the deleterious effects of these practices. ( Table 1 - Socio-economic drivers and inadequate socio-ecological behaviors in LMICs).	Poor sanitation and hygiene was reported in different studies after slaughtering food-animals and butchering poultry [ 43 , 44 , 45 ].	The study was planned to screen the marine actinobacterial extract for the protease inhibitor activity and its anti- Pf activity under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Out of 100 isolates, only 3 isolates exhibited moderate to high protease inhibitor activities on trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase K. Based on protease inhibitor activity 3 isolates were chosen for further studies. The potential isolate was characterized by polyphasic approach and identified as Streptomyces sp LK3 (JF710608). The lead compound was identified as peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3. The double-reciprocal plot displayed inhibition mode is non-competitive and it confirms the irreversible nature of protease inhibitor. The peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3 extract showed significant anti plasmodial activity (IC50: 25.78 µg/ml). In in vivo model, the highest level of parasitemia suppression (≈ 45%) was observed in 600 mg/kg of the peptide. These analyses revealed no significant changes were observed in the spleen and liver tissue during 8 dpi. The results confirmed up-regulation of TGF-β and down regulation of TNF-α in tissue and serum level in PbA infected peptide treated mice compared to PbA infection. The results obtained infer that the peptide possesses anti- Pf activity activity. It suggests that the extracts have novel metabolites and could be considered as a potential source for drug development.	10.3390/antibiotics9070372	7400606	Unrelated

B26-pharmaceutics-13-01743	Nowadays, extensive research is being carried out in nanotechnology owing to various scientific and technological fields, including pharmacology, mechanical industry, drug delivery etc. [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]. Interest in the use of nanomaterials has increased exponentially because of the smaller size, large surface-to-volume ratio, and tunable morphological properties [ 4 ]. Biosynthesized nanomaterials have recently shown proven worth applicable in various fields, including biomedical science, health, magnetic science, chemical industries, electronics, space industries, mechanics, drug and gene delivery, and have gained immense attention [ 5 ]. However, biosynthetically prepared NPs are more economical, robust, and environmentally friendly than a synthesis techniques [ 6 ]. The ZnO has emerged as a potential candidate to be used in industry as it is nontoxic, has greater photoactivity, is inexpensive, antimicrobial, and biocompatible [ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ], and has innumerable applications in the fields of cosmetics, food preservation, nanomedicines and electrode, biosensor, photocatalyst, and solar cell manufacturing [ 11 , 12 ]. Crystalline morphology and surface area ZnO NPs are used in bioactive applications, such as biosensing, antimicrobial preparations, catalysis, photonics, optoelectronics, and other technological applications [ 13 , 14 ]. The synthesis techniques also determine the ZnO properties. Many methods are used to fabricate ZnO NPs, such as thermal decomposition, spray pyrolysis, chemical precipitation, hydrothermal, and sol and gel methods [ 15 , 16 , 17 ]. However, the eco-friendly, more economical, and quickly adopted procedure of green synthesis has proven more advanced in the production of metal oxide-NPs [ 18 ]. ZnO biosynthesis provides more eco-friendly material with efficient photocatalytic activity, well-defined crystal structure, and high purity. The literature survey revealed that different metal oxide NPs like Zn, Ag, Mg, Cu, Al, etc. [ 19 , 20 ] were synthesized through the biogenic model for other economic applications. The ZnO has been biosynthesized from various plants like  Abutilon indicum  [ 21 ],  Maringa oleifera  [ 22 ],  Cinnamomum verum  [ 23 ],  Ixora coccinea  [ 24 ], and  Punica granatum  [ 25 ], which have shown excellent photocatalytic activities [ 26 ]. Origanum vulgare is a perennial herb belonging to the family Lamiaceae and has an essential role in phytotherapeutic applications. Carvacrol and thymol are the two main components of  Origanum vulgare  oil, which has antibacterial properties [ 27 , 28 ] and is used as a food flavoring with a high content of phenolic derivatives [ 29 ]. It has been reported that  Origanum vulgare  extract exhibited antimicrobial properties against some strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains, such as  P. aeruginosa ,  Bordetella bronchiseptica ,  Escherichia coli ,  Burkholderia cenocepacia ,  Acinetobacter lwoffii ,  Bacillus subtilis , and  S. aureus  [ 30 ]. Further, essential oil obtained from  Origanum vulgare  inhibits the biofilm formation of  P. fluorescens  strains and alters their motility [ 31 ].

B143	Calpain is an intracellular calcium-dependent cysteine protease ( Khorchid and Ikura, 2002 ;  Vickers, 2017 ). Calpain exists as an inactive proenzyme in the cytosol. When intracellular calcium levels increase, the proenzyme form of calpain is converted to its active form, which cleaves cytoplasmic and nuclear substrates, leading to apoptosis ( Momeni, 2011 ). Calpain activation has been implicated in myocardial injuries, including ischemia/reperfusion myocardial injury, pressure overload-induced cardiomyopathy, and heart failure ( Li et al., 2009 ;  Wang et al., 2018b ;  Wang et al., 2020 ). It has been demonstrated that DOX treatment causes calcium overload, which increases calpain activity ( Szenczi et al., 2005 ;  Emanuelov et al., 2010 ). Campos et al. established that the expression of active calpain increased in cardiomyocytes isolated from DOX-treated rats that showed dystrophin disruption in cardiac muscle ( Campos et al., 2011 ). However, a calcium-blocking agent prevented calpain activation and preserved cardiac function. Another study also investigated the calpain-induced cardiomyopathy in rats injected with DOX ( Min et al., 2015 ). Echocardiography analysis showed that DOX administration resulted in impaired cardiac function with decreased fractional shortening and thinning of the septal and left ventricular posterior wall. In contrast, rats treated with a calpain inhibitor prior to DOX injection attenuated cardiac dysfunction.  In vitro  experiments have also shown that DOX induces calpain activation in cardiomyocytes ( Lim et al., 2004 ). Calpain activation in cardiomyocytes treated with DOX resulted in myofilament protein degradation and necrosis, while calpain inhibitors preserved the myofilament protein degradation ( Lim et al., 2004 ). These studies indicate that calpain activation is one of the contributors that cause DOX-induced cardiomyopathy.

Inflammatory and progressive NAFLD can induce NASH, which is characterized by the hepatic steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, and lobular inflammation. According to studies, NASH patients are more likely than the general population to develop into hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [ 2 ]. Besides, NASH patients have an annual mortality 1.7 times higher than that of NAFLD patients [ 3 ]. NASH is one of the most common forms of chronic liver disease in developed countries, leading to a significant burden on healthcare systems worldwide. The global burden of NAFLD, and NASH in 2018 was approximately 25% and 3–5%, respectively [ 4 ]. Based on a recent meta-analysis, the prevalence of NAFLD has increased by 50%, from 25.3% in 2006 to 38.2% in 2019. The estimated global prevalence of NAFLD is approximately 30.1%, which is consistent with the increasing rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes [ 5 ].

CR is distinct from the risk of loss due to default or the inability of customers to meet short-term obligations on lending, trading, hedging settlements, and other financial agreements. The ratio of loan loss provisions to total gross loans is used to assess CR [ 112 ,  113 ]. The process of advancing or borrowing money is known as credit. A credit is generally classified as non-performing when amount of principal and interest are not recovered over 90 days or more. A higher CR indicates the poor credit management by a banks, which leads to lower profitability. To achieve higher profits, financial institutions use a higher-risk strategy [ 114 ]. Banks are required to keep more funds to deal with NPLs, which have documents negative impact on the profitability and causes decrease in the assets size of banks. A higher concentration of credit risk that occurs continuously can severely damage the financial system [ 115 ]. Several empirical studies have supported negative impact of CR on banks profitability, showing that a higher number of bad loans lead to lower profitability in banks [ 13 ,  28 ,  116 ].

The intensified mental health issues further worsened with continuous exposure to “misinformation” through social and electronic media [ 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 ]. In addition, COVID-19 infection led to other consequences, especially in the Indian sub-continent, when another disease,  Mucormycosis —a fungal infection, popularly known as Black Fungus—infected COVID-19 patients in India [ 18 ]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Black Fungus infected around 7250 people in India [ 19 ]. Black Fungus, generally caused by a fungus in the order  Mucorales , affects people, particularly diabetes patients, with a reduced ability to fight the infection, which helps the fungi to flourish more [ 19 , 20 ]. Although it is reported that Black Fungus affects 1.7 people per million, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the infection rate was eight times higher in India [ 21 ]. As of 2021, more than 40 thousand Black Fungus cases were reported, causing the death of over three thousand people [ 22 , 23 ]. Hence, the government of India declared Black Fungus as an epidemic according to the growing mortality rate [ 24 ].

B93-cancers-14-03842	Antigen-presenting cells, including DCs, macrophages, and B cells, are responsible for antigen capture, processing, and presenting via MHC-II. However, several other cells, such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, can, in some cases, present antigens to lymphocytes to trigger adaptive immune responses [ 87 , 88 , 89 , 90 , 91 ]. Among these APCs, DCs have received the most attention, and autologous DC-based cancer vaccines have achieved great success in the treatment of cancer, so much so that in 2010, a vaccine called PROVENGE (Sipuleucel-T) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of prostate cancer [ 92 ]. However, this therapeutic approach has various setbacks, including its time-consuming and costly process, as well as the limited availability of autologous cellular resources. Therefore, the development of artificial APCs was suggested to address these challenges. aAPCs are synthetic APCs composed of a cognate antigenic peptide presented by MHC molecules for binding to TCR and co-stimulatory molecules for binding to related receptors at the immunological synapse, thereby activating T cells [ 93 ].

When quantities of peroxides and reactive oxygen species (ROS) surpass natural antioxidant defenses, oxidative stress occurs [ 57 ]. Scopolamine, a physiological modulator of neurotransmitter acetylcholine, impairs learning and memory in laboratory rats [ 58 ]. Furthermore, because the brain has limited antioxidant defense systems, it is extremely vulnerable to oxidative damage [ 59 , 60 , 61 ].

B7-nanomaterials-12-02805	It has been noted that to achieve optimal absorptive losses, an effective EMI shield should maintain high magnetic permeability and electrical conductivity. Therefore, accordingly, the current strategy in shielding enhancement is to combine specific materials with these critical and effective properties [ 5 , 6 , 7 ], for instance, polymer foam-based composites. These composites are widely used in these applications due to their lower density, corrosion and wear resistance, competitive prices, and high flexibility. On the other hand, the majority of polymer foams are considered as electrical insulators [ 7 , 8 ]. To overcome these limitations and enhance the electrical conductivity of the polymer matrix, a conductive filler can be an effective candidate in such a way as to improve the global conductivity of these compositions. In this sense, a wide range of metallic fillers (e.g., Ag, Au, Cu nanoparticles) [ 9 , 10 ] and carbon-based fillers (e.g., carbon black, carbon nanofibers, carbon nanotubes, and graphene) have been extensively utilized [ 11 , 12 ]. It has been reported that using carbon nanofillers to improve the polymer foam’s conductivity is highly efficient compared to using metallic fillers. This can be attributed to their outstanding characteristics such as higher conductivity, great tensile strength, Young’s modulus, fewer corrosion problems, and lower density [ 13 ]. In addition, graphene is widely employed as a filler in different matrices for EMI SE applications. Graphene is a two-dimensional nanomaterial with remarkable electrical characteristics, making it a promising candidate for EMI shielding [ 14 ]. Moreover, chemically reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and thermally exfoliated graphene (TEG) have been investigated for EMI shielding, individually or in conjunction with other conducting or magnetic substances [ 15 , 16 ].

However, numerous antioxidant substances that have been employed to reduce hepatic oxidative stress have been studied within the scope of earlier investigations (Eşrefogˇlu et al.  2007 ; Layachi and Kechrid  2012 ; Vickers  2017 ; Zafeer et al.  2012 ). According to Ağır et al., DS has powerful antioxidant properties. Cd-induced liver damage is known to occur via oxidative stress and different mechanisms. In situations of probable Cd exposure, DS may be administered as a supplemental drug with main therapeutic approaches to minimize liver damage.

28743020	No title	cit10	The requirement for energy is increasing rapidly due to the increasing population with each passing day. 1  The energy produced by traditional methods can no longer meet the energy needs of modern society, so that is why new methods are being developed to generate and implements energy. 2–4  Energy storage devices are essential along with renewable energy resources for the continuous supply of energy. Traditional energy storage devices include batteries and capacitors. Supercapacitors (SCs) are an intermediate point between capacitors and conventional batteries. 5,6  The energy densities of Li-ion batteries (LIBs) reached 150 to 200 W h kg −1 , 7,8  which are significantly higher compared to other battery types, such as Ni–Cd 9,10  Ni–MH, 9  and lead batteries. 9  Applications for electric vehicles are now feasible thanks to SCs with high power densities, longer life cycles, and fast charging. 11  SCs are cheaper than batteries and provide good power with a moderate energy density. 12–14  The SCs are considered a main electrical energy storage EES because of their good energy and power densities. 10,11,15–18  According to their storing method, SCs are further divided into PCs (pseudo capacitors) and EDLCs (electric double-layer capacitors). Metal sulfide and conductive polymers are the most frequently used for PCs because of their electrochemical properties. 19–21  Owing to a shortage of energy production, electrical energy storage systems are being modified to meet energy requirements. This issue was solved by combining the characteristics of batteries and supercapacitors in a single hybrid device. 22  Supercapatteries are hybrid devices that utilize both a capacitive electrode and a battery electrode. 23  Compared to the present LIBs, supercapacitors, and supercapatteries have shown a reasonable potential for energy and power density. 11  Supercapatteries have a substantially greater energy density than supercapacitors. 24–27  Layered and non-layered sulfides are the two primary groups into which the metal sulfides (MSs) can be separated. Non-layered metal sulfide MSs with high theoretical capacities are FeS 2 , NiS 2 , CoS 2 , and MnS. They are also commonly accessible, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly. 28–30  Covalent bonds in semi-metal sulfides join the layers to form the layered MSs, including MoS 2 , WS 2 , SnS 2 , VS 2 , and many others. 31–36  Changing morphologies, sizes, structures, and compositions makes it possible to change the electrochemical properties of MSs. 37,38  Layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with the structural formula MX 2  have gained a lot of attention due to their huge potential for energy storage applications. 39  In MX 2 , X stands for Se, Te, S, and M denotes transition metal element. 40  Because of its excellent electrical conductivity, higher specific capacity, and long cycle life, NbS has become more popular as an anode material. 41  Liao  et al.  studied the use of Nb oxides for advanced hybrid capacitors. But still, there is a lot of work needed on Nb-based electrode material for SCs. 42  Niobium (Nb)-based materials have incredible potential for use in supercapacitors (SCs). However, the conductivity of niobium may be successfully increased by merging Nb with two metals. Niobium sulfide has excellent flexibility, hardness, electrical conductivity, long cycle life, high energy storage capacity, and extraordinary electrochemical properties. 43  Silver sulfide (Ag 2 S) nanomaterial is commonly utilized in batteries, thermoelectric sensors, infrared finders, photovoltaic cells, and conductors. 44  The ellipsoidal-shaped Ag 2 S nano crystals size range lies from 5 to 20 nm. 45  According to Pawar  et al. , Ag 2 S had a high specific capacity, greater chemical and electrical conductivity, and is naturally abundant. 46,47	Supercapacitors (SCs) are an intermediate point between capacitors and conventional batteries. 5,6  The energy densities of Li-ion batteries (LIBs) reached 150 to 200 W h kg −1 , 7,8  which are significantly higher compared to other battery types, such as Ni–Cd 9,10  Ni–MH, 9  and lead batteries. 9  Applications for electric vehicles are now feasible thanks to SCs with high power densities, longer life cycles, and fast charging. 11  SCs are cheaper than batteries and provide good power with a moderate energy density. 12–14  The SCs are considered a main electrical energy storage EES because of their good energy and power densities. 10,11,15–18  According to their storing method, SCs are further divided into PCs (pseudo capacitors) and EDLCs (electric double-layer capacitors).

B94-biomedicines-08-00261	Increasing evidence demonstrates that the dosage forms and conditions of patients can affect the absorption of Res. However, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is involved in the absorption of Res after oral administration with a peak at plasma concentration after 30 min and 1.5–2 h [ 75 , 76 , 77 ]. The absorption of Res undergoes an increase via grape consumption and using other forms such as micronized form [ 78 , 79 , 80 , 81 , 82 ]. After absorption, Res can be distributed in different organs, such as the brain, liver, intestine, and fat [ 83 ]. For metabolism, enterocytes and hepatocytes play the most important role after oral administration. Notably, Res influx occurs through the passive diffusion and carrier-mediated process [ 84 , 85 ]. The metabolism of Res also confirms its distribution in liver, so that it has been reported that Res is a substrate of hepatic sulfotransferase and glucuronosyltransferase, and it extensively accumulates in liver [ 86 ]. The interesting point is that metabolism of Res relies on dose. Low doses (5–50 mg) of Res are bio-transformed into glucuronides, while high doses (more than 250 mg) are bio-transformed into monosulfates [ 87 , 88 , 89 , 90 , 91 ]. Facial areas and urine are responsible for the elimination of Res. It has been noted that the administration form of Res may affect its elimination, which can be delayed when micronized Res is used [ 92 , 93 , 94 , 95 , 96 ].

Industrial dyes and pollutants can cause major sickness in humans and animals, like cancer, skin sensitivities, allergies, or liver malfunction. 6  Over the last decade, a substantial burden on the dairy industry is mastitis, which is followed by somatic variation in the milk and irregularity of mammary gland function. Mastitis is attributable to species, namely, bacteria, fungi, and viruses. 7 S. aureus  and  E. coli  are found to be common pathogenic bacteria causing a threat to human health. 8  Membrane separation, chemical oxidation, coagulation, flocculation, chemical precipitation, catalysis, photocatalysis, and adsorption processes were employed for removing heavy metals and dyes from water resources. 9–14  However, there are several limitations linked to these methodologies including incompetence, complicated and expensive procedure, elevated application and usage of a significant amount of energy. 2  Metal oxides including ZnO·Pr 6 O 11 , La 2 O 3 , TiO 2 , CdO, CeO 2 , CaO, and Fe 2 O 3 , and zero-valent metals (ZVM) are frequently chosen as promising co-catalysts. 15  They can be used in several applications including efficient catalysis, medical diagnosis, and UV protection. 16  Among them, calcium oxide (CaO) is advantageous because of its non-poisonous nature, as well as low cost, extensive band gap energy ( E g ), more stability, and higher catalytic activity (CA). The oxygen ion absorption is also enhanced using CaO, which is crucial for the catalysis process. CaO in bulk has a large  E g  of 7.1 eV (ref.  17  and  18 ) and a high  ε  of 11.8 (dielectric constant). However, CaO has limitations such as large  E g  and disability to utilize visible light in the degradation of dyes. 19–21  To overcome these limitations, various approaches have been adopted, which increase catalytic degradation as well as antibacterial action of CaO by doping polymers including St, acrylic binder, alginate, chitosan, and polyimide. 22  Recently, St has been proven to be an important industrial raw material that is utilized in different industries including foods, chemicals and medicines, as a fat substitute, water treatment agent and catalyst. 23,24  St is a naturally occurring biological macromolecule that acts as a catalyst for the elimination of dyes. 25  The CA of CaO can be further increased by doping group III members; Al-doped metal oxides exhibit less electrical resistance and good optical transmission in the visible region. However, we choose Al as a dopant. 26  In the present work, we adopted a co-precipitation approach to synthesize Al and St-doped CaO with different concentrations of Al (0, 2 and 4 wt%). The prepared products act as catalysts to remove the harmful dye MB. Its antibacterial action against different bacteria was also investigated.

Figure 2 (e) represents the main effects plot of UAE extraction temperature, time, and ethanol concentration on the FRAP activity of hog plum pulp. It is clear from  Figure 2 (e) and the ANOVA test for FRAP ( Table 4 ) that extraction temperature (X 1 ), extraction time (X 2 ), and ethanol concentration (X 3 ) significantly ( p  < 0.01) affect the FRAP assay of hog plum pulp. It was observed that the hog plum pulp extracts with higher temperature ranges from 60 to 80 °C showed increased FRAP value. The temperature-dependent trend in FRAP activity observed experimentally could be explained by changes in solvent characteristics with temperature and decomposition or alteration of the extract. As the temperature rises, more compounds may be extracted due to increased diffusivity within the extraction media and relaxation of the food matrix, which may account for the increase in FRAP activity from 60 to 80 °C. Hossain and Hossain [ 100 ] reported the maximum FRAP activity in Burmese grape pulp at 80 °C. In previous investigations, Hani et al. [ 101 ] and Deng et al. [ 92 ] recorded 60 °C and 68 °C as the optimal temperature in the UAE for bitter gourd and sugar apple, respectively. Similarly, the results showed a significant ( p  < 0.01) effect of extraction time on FRAP activity of hog plum pulp extract. Precisely, the values were decreased when the extraction time was increased from 30 to 60 min. The decline of FRAP activity may be related to the oxidation of phenolic compounds caused by prolonged exposure to environmental variables such as light and oxygen [ 102 ]. The results were also explained by Fick’s second rule of diffusion, which states that after a specific time, there will be a final equilibrium between the solute concentration in the solid matrix (plant sample) and the bulk solution (extraction solvent) [ 103 ]. Hence, an optimal time is required to extract more phenolic compounds from hog plum pulp. The present study recorded the highest FRAP activity between 30 to 45 min. Chen et al. [ 104 ], Kashyap et al. [ 105 ], and Deng et al. [ 92 ], all demonstrated the maximum FRAP activity for  Lycium ruthenicum  Murr.

CR78	As shown in Fig.  1 , the link between food, energy, water, and waste (FEWW) is investigated as an important issue (Garcia et al.,  2019 ; Kibler et al.,  2018 ). The FEWW nexus can be defined as an approach to estimating, developing, and implementing policies that consider optimal conditions for each segment in the nexus. Nexus provides a conceptual and analytical approach to socio-environmental systems and offers a framework for coordinating segments and managing natural resources (Costa,  2015 ). Many elements in the FEWW nexus interact with each other, and also they associate with various environmental, social, and economic factors (Smith et al.,  2014 ). For example, the COVID-19 outbreak has affected energy consumption; restrictions like curfews have reduced fuel consumption (De Vos,  2020 ). Moreover, since people prefer to stay home, demand for residential electricity has increased. On the other hand, regarding the closure of industrial and commercial units, the amount of electricity loads in these sectors has significantly decreased (Senthilkumar et al.,  2020 ). Additionally, coronavirus affects the water sources since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been diagnosed in untreated wastewater (Vickers,  2017 ). Moreover, water consumption in residential areas has slightly increased, but commercial and industrial consumption declined during the COVID-19 pandemic (Kalbusch et al.,  2020 ).

B7-jcm-12-07721	Although the incidence of post-surgical double-J ureteral stent (DJUS) insertion has decreased, the potential issue of benign ureteroileal anastomotic stricture (UIAS) remains and can occur in 0–19% of patients within 1–2 years of performing urinary diversion [ 3 , 4 ]. UIAS can occur due to ureteroenteric ischemia resulting from the extended separation of the distal end of the ureter and poor suturing techniques, leading to fibrous scar hyperplasia [ 5 ]. Should the ureteral outlet stricture not be addressed in a timely manner, complicated upper urinary tract infections, stones, renal insufficiency, and other serious complications may develop [ 6 , 7 , 8 ]. DJUS insertion is the most used method for the treatment of benign ureteral strictures. Ureteral stents can be used alone or in combination with balloon dilation [ 9 , 10 ]. Previous studies have shown that DJUSs after balloon dilation can prevent ureteral rebound and scar contraction, help drain urine, and restore renal function.

B9-molecules-28-02838	Dyes and pharmaceutical pollutants are becoming the most serious commercial organic contaminants due to their poisonous and carcinogenic nature. Both people and drinking water are vulnerable to the harmful effects of organic contaminants. The pharmaceuticals, especially ‘antibiotics’, due to their increased global consumption, have raised a universal concern, as their excessive usage is polluting the water sources used for both human and agricultural purposes. Among antibiotics, tetracycline (TC) is the most commonly used antibiotic worldwide. The fundamental structural constituent of TC is a tetracyclic ring structure comprising hydroxyl, methyl, keto, and the dimethylamino functional groups. Despite the number of health benefits of TC, it is still considered a pollutant, as it enters water sources through humans or animal excreta. TC is reportedly found in domestic wastewater and hospital wastewater in evident concentrations of 1 µg L −1  and 100 µg L −1 , respectively [ 1 , 2 ]. The elimination of organic pollutants (drugs + dyes) from the discharge of industrial wastewater, hospital wastewater, and domestic wastewater has received recognition in the field of environmental remediation. Organic dyes are carbon-containing complex compounds enriched with aromatic rings, and their nitro, sulfo, chloro, and ami-docyanogen series are particularly prevalent in industrial effluents, which are the primary source of water contamination. Color effluents from dyes and colour industries are not only causing colour problems in water bodies, but they are also becoming a source of pollution for living organisms by reducing or even stopping light and water re-oxygenation capacities, resulting in an interruption in aquatic life. These dyes have the potential to deplete dissolved O 2 , as well as to be hazardous to plants, wildlife, and humans. Methylene blue [ 3 ], crystal violet [ 4 ], malachite green [ 5 ], rhodamine-B [ 6 ], and other [ 7 ] dyes are among those that are considered harmful pollutants when they are found in water systems above the permitted limits and pollute the water sources. Thus, the invention of efficient methods to manage water contamination is currently considered a major issue in this field of study. Different methods have been implemented to eliminate the organic contaminants, including chemical oxidants, membrane processes, adsorption, and flotation. Nevertheless, the majority of the aforementioned procedures generate dangerous by-products and necessitate costly treatment methods. On the basis of this perspective, photocatalysis has garnered a significant amount of interest in the sector of environmental remediation due to the utilization of solar light, which is both a constant non-degrading source and also capable of degrading organic contaminants without producing any carcinogenic by-products [ 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ]. Semiconductor photo catalysts are commonly used to transform light into chemical energy. The non-toxic characteristics of ZnO, combined with its features such as its economy and large surface area, have contributed to its being recognised as a leading candidate for a catalyst [ 12 ]. It is amazing that ZnO is a robust photocatalyst and is vulnerable to photocorrosion, supporting its recyclability [ 13 ]. However, pure ZnO suffers from poor quantum yield. This is because photogenerated electron-hole pairs recombine very quickly, which limits their application in photocatalysis [ 14 ]. In particular, doping other metal ions into the crystal system creates the intermediate band structure below the conduction band of ZnO, which helps to harvest a larger amount of the solar spectrum. In particular, the catalytic performance of ZnO can be boosted by doping it with metal ions, which results in defects being created in the crystal structure. In addition, metal ions can play the role of electron-trapping agents, preventing electron-hole recombination and favouring charge separation. The photocatalytic reactions can be enhanced by adding metal ions to the ZnO matrix [ 15 , 16 ]. Recently, it was reported that ZnO nanoparticles synthesized through precipitation method using sodium dodecyl sulfate can degrade 49% of tetracycline [ 17 ]. Similarly, the Ni doping in ZnO matrix decreased the recombination rate of the charge carriers and resulted in enhanced photodegradation efficiency (94%) for the removal of methylene blue dye [ 18 ]. A growing number of researchers are looking to rare earth metals as a dopant to improve photo catalysts for the decomposition of organic contaminants [ 19 , 20 ]. Rare earth enhances photocatalytic efficacy while decreasing electron-hole recombination. Rare-earth metals have an imperfect 4f orbital configuration, which helps to corral the electron, which minimises the recombination of charge carriers as well as increasing the catalytic performance [ 21 ]. In particular, the 4f electron configuration and multi-electron organization of rare-earth metals provide high thermal resistance to the ZnO structure. Vaiano et al. [ 22 ] modified ZnO with praseodymium (Pr) and observed exceptional photocatalytic performance under the exposure of ultraviolet and visible light. Zong et al. and Korake et al. investigated the excellent photocatalytic performance of eu-doped ZnO nanoparticles [ 23 , 24 ]. Okte et al. described the synthesis of several rare earth (La, Eu, Gd, Dy, and Ho)-loaded ZnOs and investigated their photocatalytic performance in the removal of methyl orange dye [ 25 ]. The photocatalytic efficiency of Ln (La, Nd, or Sm)-doped zinc oxide nanoparticles in the decomposition of p-nitrophenol was investigated by Khatamian et al. [ 19 ]. However, Nb doped ZnO (0.25 g/L) has the capacity to degrade 75.7% of TC (15 mg/L) in 150 min of experiment. The observed results were explained in terms of greater surface area and a narrow band gap in Nd doped ZnO catalysts [ 26 ]. Researchers mainly interested in photocatalysis for the removal of waste water may consider the involvement of rare earth metals doped into ZnO to be relevant to the presented findings. ZnO nanoparticles doped with rare-earth metal ions still need to be explored for optimal photocatalytic efficiency for the degradation of organic contaminants. Moreover, the induction of a few percent of rare earth elements into a ZnO matrix can induce room temperature magnetism, which is the required condition for spintronic applications [ 27 , 28 ]. However, the cause of room temperature magnetism is still controversial and needs to be explored. Both photo catalytic degradation and spintronic applications of ZnO rely directly on the synthesis route which may optimize the crystallite size, lattice defects, morphology, band gap, and magnetic properties. Rare earth doping into the ZnO structure has emerged as an effective way to modify these properties, especially defects chemistry, which plays a crucial role in determining the efficacy of the catalyst. In the present work, we have successfully synthesized rare earth doped ZnO nanoparticles, characterised them for structural, optical, and magnetic properties, and used them to degrade the tetracycline drug under UV-visible light irradiation, inspired by the potential of rare earth doping into ZnO for optimising the properties and applications in wastewater treatment. For the purposes of comparison, the malachite green and crystal violet dyes have also been tested for degradation.

Numerous health consequences, including diabetes, CVD, and cancer, have been linked to heme iron [ 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 ]. Lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress indicators can be brought on by dietary iron [ 44 , 45 ]. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) can oxidize with the help of heme iron, perhaps acting as a catalyst. This can lead to inflammation that damages tissue and raises the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [ 44 ].	Heme iron has prooxidant properties that may encourage oxidative injury and inflammation in several organs  39 . Numerous health consequences, including diabetes, CVD, and cancer, have been linked to heme iron  40 , 41 , 42 , 43 .	The study was planned to screen the marine actinobacterial extract for the protease inhibitor activity and its anti- Pf activity under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Out of 100 isolates, only 3 isolates exhibited moderate to high protease inhibitor activities on trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase K. Based on protease inhibitor activity 3 isolates were chosen for further studies. The potential isolate was characterized by polyphasic approach and identified as Streptomyces sp LK3 (JF710608). The lead compound was identified as peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3. The double-reciprocal plot displayed inhibition mode is non-competitive and it confirms the irreversible nature of protease inhibitor. The peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3 extract showed significant anti plasmodial activity (IC50: 25.78 µg/ml). In in vivo model, the highest level of parasitemia suppression (≈ 45%) was observed in 600 mg/kg of the peptide. These analyses revealed no significant changes were observed in the spleen and liver tissue during 8 dpi. The results confirmed up-regulation of TGF-β and down regulation of TNF-α in tissue and serum level in PbA infected peptide treated mice compared to PbA infection. The results obtained infer that the peptide possesses anti- Pf activity activity. It suggests that the extracts have novel metabolites and could be considered as a potential source for drug development.	10.3390/nu16030344	10857363	Unrelated

Even though the viral replication is mainly confined to the respiratory tract, previous findings revealed that replication of SARS-CoV-2 in extrapulmonary tissues like the pancreas, colon, tonsils, and ilium [ 56 , 57 ]. Though, it is notable that the ACE2 receptor is expressed in numerous tissues and organs such as the heart, intestine, brain, adipose tissue, pancreas, kidney, vasculature, and liver, making them potential targets for COVID-19, which may clarify the destruction reported in multi-organ systems in patients with COVID-19 [ 56 , 58 , 59 ]. Remarkably, the risk factors like obesity and DM are associated with an increased expression of ACE2 in different tissues, leading to a possible rise in the viral load [ 60 , 61 ]. Moreover, the flaking of ACE2 from the cell surface and its redistribution, usually detected in obese and diabetic people, supports the viral spread to various body parts [ 60 ].

Furthermore, Metformin-mediated AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of ACE2 extends ACE2 half-life and hence potentially offers lung protection [ 63 ]. In contrast, it is theorized that Metformin could stabilize ACE2 expression in the respiratory tract and probably rise SARS-CoV-2 infection [ 64 ]. Though, it is notable that viral binding to the ACE2 declines ACE2 availability and stability, leading to the manifestation of harmful biological effects (fibrotic, vasoconstrictive, proliferative, and pro-hypertrophic, induction of oxidative stress, and inflammatory effects) and an imbalance in the RAAS in various body parts [ 29 , 58 ].

The placenta, umbilical cord, and amnion are all sources of MSCs. The term “human amnion-derived MSCs” (hAD-MSCs) is frequently used to refer to the stem cells that can be found in amniotic fluid as well as human amniotic epithelial cells [ 173 , 174 , 175 ]. MSCs obtained from the umbilical cord have a very low initial immunogenicity, making them suitable for allogeneic treatment [ 176 ]. Compared to perivascular stem cells (PSCs) from umbilical veins or MSCs produced from Wharton’s jelly, PSCs from umbilical arteries are more likely to express the Notch Ligand Jagged 1 than MSCs from the umbilical cord [ 177 ]. Rebuilding ovarian function frequently involves the use of human chorionic plate-derived MSCs (hCMSCs), also known as human placenta-derived MSCs (hPMSCs). It has been demonstrated that hPMSCs secrete a variety of cell factors, including IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 [ 178 ].

24618707	Protease inhibitors from marine actinobacteria as a potential source for antimalarial compound	CR56	The nsSNPs that were predicted as pathogenic, highly conserved with decreased protein stability, and possessing PTM sites were chosen to proceed with 3D protein modelling using 1h88.1.C template. To construct the 3D structures for wild-type and mutants MYB proteins, two distinct homology-modelling tools were employed: Phyre2 (Protein Homology/analogy Recognition Engine V 2.0) [ http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/html/page.cgi?id=index ] 51  and SWISS-MODEL [ https://swissmodel.expasy.org/ ] 52 . Each nsSNP was individually substituted into the respective sequence of each MYB protein and then submitted to Phyre2 for the creation of 3D mutant models based on selected templates. TM-align (Template Modelling-align) [ https://zhanggroup.org/TM-align/ ] 53  was utilised to investigate the similarities between the modelled wild-type and mutant protein structures by computing template modelling-score (TM-score) and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values. TM-score yields a result from 0 to 1, where 1 denotes a perfect match between both structures 54 . Precisely, 0.0 < TM-score < 0.30 indicates random structural similarity, whereas 0.50 < TM-score < 1.00 implies that both structures are within the same fold 55 , 56 . A lower TM-score and a higher RMSD value indicate a greater structural deviation of mutant models from those of wild-type 57 . To build the 3D models in SWISS-MODEL, templates were analysed and selected based on coverage, sequence identity, qualitative model energy analysis (QMEAN) Z-score, and global model quality estimation (GMQE) score. A QMEAN Z-score of ≤ − 4.0 denotes a low quality model 58 . The GMQE score, which ranges from 0 to 1, indicates the likely accuracy of the model constructed with that alignment and the target coverage 59 . Therefore, templates with higher sequence similarities and a higher GMQE value were prioritized, concurrent with the coverage of the mutation site in that template, thus, template 1h88.1.C was selected. The built models were then validated by ERRAT [ https://saves.mbi.ucla.edu/ ] and PROCHECK Ramachandran plot analysis [ https://saves.mbi.ucla.edu/ ] to estimate their structural quality.

Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis is important to understand diverse biological processes including cell proliferation ( Nooren and Thornton, 2003 ), signal transduction ( Pawson and Nash, 2000 ), DNA transcription, replication ( Zhang et al., 2012 ;  Vickers, 2017 ), hormone regulation ( Zhao, 2015 ), cycle control ( Kulminskaya and Oberer, 2020 ), and neuro-transmission ( Südhof, 1995 ). It also helps to identify disease-related signaling pathways and symbolize unfamiliar targets for therapeutic intervention ( You et al., 2010 ). In-depth exploration of PPIs is critical for a thorough understanding of protein functionalities, genetic mechanisms ( Wang et al., 2007 ;  Alberts, 1998 ), discovery of new drug targets ( Andrei et al., 2017 ), and development of effective preventive or therapeutic strategies to combat diseases ( Petta et al., 2016 ).

Each of these cells has a specific function in the immune system that is different from other lymphocytes. Regulatory T cells are considered effective cells in the immune system that play an important role in infectious diseases [ 30 , 31 ]. T cell activity is associated with less disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating that T cells play an essential role in controlling and treating primary SARS-CoV-2 infection [ 32 ]. T cells play a crucial role in harmonizing antiviral immune responses that cause the death of infected cells or mediate humoral responses. Current data emphasize that while not all patients can develop a protective humoral immune response, a sustained T-cell reaction develops.

MERS-CoV was the second major coronavirus in the 21st century. The particular mechanism of transmission, on the other hand, is yet uncertain. Despite the fact that the vast majority of MERS-CoV cases occurred in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, there have been cases also in South Korea, parts of Europe, North America, and a total of 27 more countries. According to the World Health Organization, the disease is widespread in Saudi Arabia, with one human fatality reported between January and February 2022. At this time, there is no vaccine or treatment for the disease, and containment techniques such as isolation of suspected or confirmed human cases have been used to limit the transmission risk. It has been shown that in the event of an outbreak, the characteristics of the index case can significantly influence the disease spread pattern and scale, which may be accelerated by the transmission inside hospitals ( Chowell et al., 2014 ;  for Disease Prevention EC, 2019 ). On the other hand, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with the infection being commonly referred to as COVID-19, rapidly spread globally, producing a pandemic with approximately 497 million cases and 6.1 million deaths at the time of writing ( Vickers, 2017 ). In Saudi Arabia, the first case was confirmed on March 2, 2020 – an individual who had travelled from Iran via Bahrain. As of July 26, 2021, 518143 cases had been confirmed ( ali Salih et al., 2020 ). Many of the initial cases were imported from Iran, with later cases being caused by the local transmission. Public health interventions included identifying potential contacts of confirmed cases; monitoring close contacts and quarantining for 14 days from their last exposure to an identified case. In addition, low-risk contacts were put under active surveillance and contacted daily to monitor their health status ( Huang et al., 2020 ).

10.1371/journal.pone.0090972	Protease inhibitors from marine actinobacteria as a potential source for antimalarial compound	ref38	A growing number of people are suffering from complicated lifestyle disorders such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), infertility, diabetes, depression, and cancer. These conditions require special care and treatment to achieve optimal quality of life. These diseases have become a burden on modern society because they are significantly linked to accelerating cellular aging ( Boccardi et al., 2016 ;  Tolahunase et al., 2017 ). Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with a significantly increased risk of developing serious medical illnesses that are more commonly seen with advanced age, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, immune impairments, stroke, dementia and osteoporosis. A major depressive episode has been compared to “accelerated ageing,” with an increased risk of aging-related disorders ( Thimmapuram et al., 2017 ). The human body undergoes constant changes, causing changes in cells and tissues over the course of a lifetime. Some changes that occur in cells are normal processes that help keep the body healthy. Other changes can occur as a result of certain diseases or conditions, such as cancer or aging ( Lipton, 2008 ). Certain cells in the body have specialized structures called telomeres, which are the protective caps found at the end of chromosomes that shorten with each cell division. Eventually, if the telomeres are too short, the cells cannot divide anymore and become damaged, which can lead to cell death. Cellular senescence is another consequence of shortened telomeres ( Blackburn, 2000 ). Telomere length has an impact on total life expectancy, and telomere shortening is a sign of molecular aging ( Blackburn, 2009 ;  Beery et al., 2012 ;  Karthik et al., 2014 ;  Alda et al., 2016 ;  Thimmapuram et al., 2017 ). Telomere shortening has been linked to cytotoxic stresses such as oxidative stress, which destroys telomeric DNA more than non-telomeric DNA, and chronic inflammation, even in non-dividing cells. Increased telomere shortening makes cells more vulnerable to apoptosis and death ( Wolkowitz et al., 2011 ).	Telomere length has an impact on total life expectancy, and telomere shortening is a sign of molecular aging ( Blackburn, 2009 ;  Beery et al., 2012 ;  Karthik et al., 2014 ;  Alda et al., 2016 ;  Thimmapuram et al., 2017 ).	The study was planned to screen the marine actinobacterial extract for the protease inhibitor activity and its anti- Pf activity under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Out of 100 isolates, only 3 isolates exhibited moderate to high protease inhibitor activities on trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase K. Based on protease inhibitor activity 3 isolates were chosen for further studies. The potential isolate was characterized by polyphasic approach and identified as Streptomyces sp LK3 (JF710608). The lead compound was identified as peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3. The double-reciprocal plot displayed inhibition mode is non-competitive and it confirms the irreversible nature of protease inhibitor. The peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3 extract showed significant anti plasmodial activity (IC50: 25.78 µg/ml). In in vivo model, the highest level of parasitemia suppression (≈ 45%) was observed in 600 mg/kg of the peptide. These analyses revealed no significant changes were observed in the spleen and liver tissue during 8 dpi. The results confirmed up-regulation of TGF-β and down regulation of TNF-α in tissue and serum level in PbA infected peptide treated mice compared to PbA infection. The results obtained infer that the peptide possesses anti- Pf activity activity. It suggests that the extracts have novel metabolites and could be considered as a potential source for drug development.	10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1158760	10278541	Unrelated
10.1371/journal.pone.0090972	Protease inhibitors from marine actinobacteria as a potential source for antimalarial compound	ref38	In recent years, there has been a growing interest in exploring the possible impacts of meditation practice on telomere dynamics, in addition to diet and physical activity ( Dyrbye et al., 2008 ). In leukocytes, psychological stress has been linked to rapid telomere shortening, whereas meditation has been linked to increased telomere length ( Blackburn, 2009 ;  Beery et al., 2012 ;  Karthik et al., 2014 ;  Thimmapuram et al., 2017 ). Shorter telomeres are also linked with diseased conditions diseases ( Zhao et al., 2013 ;  Haycock et al., 2014 ;  Ridout et al., 2016 ). A growing body of research suggests that meditation, which has been shown to support healthy biological processes, may also affect biomarkers associated with aging. The findings suggest that practicing mindful meditation may be one way to build resilience against disease through maintaining a healthy body and mind ( Sudsuang et al., 1991 ;  Pace et al., 2009 ;  Lengacher et al., 2014 ;  Turan et al., 2015 ;  Alda et al., 2016 ;  Álvarez-López et al., 2022 ). In fact, intensive meditation training has been linked to increased telomerase activity ( Jacobs et al., 2011 ) and longer telomere length in blood cells, which are considered potential biomarkers of human ageing. Recent research suggests that these factors may be influenced by psychological stress, stress assessments, and well-being ( Epel et al., 2004 ;  Walvekar et al., 2015 ;  Alda et al., 2016 ). Investigations have demonstrated a beneficial correlation between meditation and longer telomeres ( Alda et al., 2016 ) in addition to an increase in telomerase ( Zi and Shuai, 2013 ), suggesting that meditation may be crucial for disease prevention.	In leukocytes, psychological stress has been linked to rapid telomere shortening, whereas meditation has been linked to increased telomere length ( Blackburn, 2009 ;  Beery et al., 2012 ;  Karthik et al., 2014 ;  Thimmapuram et al., 2017 ).

B9-nutrients-16-01088	Several tools have been developed to screen the nutritional status of patients on admission to the hospital, including the Nutrition Status Control Index (CONUT), the Geriatric Nutrition Risk Index (GNRI), and the Prognostic Nutrition Index (PNI), all of which are highly effective for early detection of malnutrition [ 6 ]. The CONUT score is calculated by serum albumin concentration, total peripheral lymphocyte count, and total cholesterol concentration, being the most commonly used screening tool for early detection of poor nutritional status [ 7 ]. In various studies, CONUT score was shown to have a strong association with patient prognosis and the presence of a cardiovascular disease, including coronary heart disease and congestive heart failure [ 8 , 9 ]. Although malnutrition has been reported to be associated with a high mortality rate in coronary heart disease and heart failure, little is known about the relationship between malnutrition and adverse cardiovascular events in patients with AMI in the post-infarction period [ 10 ]. Myocardial infarction poses an increasing burden on healthcare systems as its incidence is steadily rising and is responsible for a large proportion of deaths and reduced quality of life [ 11 ]. Both in-hospital and 1- and 3-month follow-up outcomes of patients admitted with AMI remain unsatisfactory due to particularly high mortality rates, reaching up to 8% at 3-month follow up according to Choles A.H. et al. [ 12 ].

Consequently, in the drug discovery process, ADMET pharmacokinetic parameters and drug similarity are now determined early on for preliminary estimation. In silico studies offer a pathway to assess crucial ADMET parameters, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity ( Vickers, 2017 ). The processes involved in drug development include absorption, which refers to the uptake of compounds in the human small intestine; distribution, which involves the movement of compounds throughout the body tissues; metabolism, which pertains to the chemical biotransformation of a compound by the body; excretion, which is the removal of a compound from the body; and the assessment of the compound's toxicity level.

B80-polymers-16-01959	Electrodialysis (ED) is a membrane-based technology widely utilized for seawater desalination. It involves the arrangement of numerous anion exchange membranes (AEM) and cation exchange membranes (CEM) placed alternately between two electrodes ( Figure 6 ). The electrolyte solution flows through the electrode compartment, while the feed solution traverses the adjacent compartment. When a voltage is applied, a reduction reaction occurs at the cathode, during which hydroxide ions are formed. Similarly, within the anode compartment, an oxidation process occurs, leading to the production of protons. There are slight variations in selectivity for different ions among various membranes used in ED, and the accumulation of divalent ions often leads to membrane fouling. Furthermore, these membranes tend to be expensive. Additionally, ion-exchange nanofibrous membranes are frequently regarded as a means to enhance the flow and permeability of membranes that selectively filter monovalent and divalent ions [ 78 , 79 , 80 ].

Environmental factors such as moisture and soil temperature, which are often variably influenced by organic amendments, can regulate the diversity and community composition of soil organisms ( Carey et al., 2015 ;  Vickers, 2017 ). As an organic amendment, FM could effectively increase soil pH, drainage and stimulate soil microbial activities ( Tandon, 1995 ;  Yang et al., 2013 ). Some  Proteobacteria  members like the  Betaproteobacteria  are referred to as copiotrophic, and thrive in an environmental condition with a high C content and other nutrients ( Fierer, Bradford & Jackson, 2007 ;  Yang et al., 2019 ;  Ibrahim et al., 2020a ). This could explain their increased relative abundance in the FM treatments compared to the control (CK). The  Acidobacteria  had a higher relative abundance in the CK compared to FM-treated soils. This phylum is often found in low fertility soil, which explains its abundance in the CK treatment. Similar to our observations,  Acidobacteria  had a negative correlation with soil pH, as previously reported by  Lauber et al. (2009)  and  Rousk et al. (2010) . Generally,  Acidobacteria  is referred to as Oligotrophs that grow successfully in natural cropland ecosystems ( Pershina et al., 2015 ) and have been reported to contribute to the degradation of recalcitrant organic compounds ( Fierer et al., 2012 ). Similarly,  Bryant & Frigaard (2006)  considered the  Chloroflexi  taxa as anoxygenic phototrophs, which play an essential role in the process of nitrification. However, the lower nitrification in the FM-based treatments where they were slightly increased may indicate that their taxonomic members present were not actively involved in the nitrification process.

Patients with EPTB have enlarged lymph nodes and musculoskeletal pain and they also complain of other types of non-specific symptoms [ 6 – 8 ].	Patients with EPTB have enlarged lymph nodes and musculoskeletal pain and they also complain of other types of non-specific symptoms [ 6 – 8 ].	The study was planned to screen the marine actinobacterial extract for the protease inhibitor activity and its anti- Pf activity under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Out of 100 isolates, only 3 isolates exhibited moderate to high protease inhibitor activities on trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase K. Based on protease inhibitor activity 3 isolates were chosen for further studies. The potential isolate was characterized by polyphasic approach and identified as Streptomyces sp LK3 (JF710608). The lead compound was identified as peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3. The double-reciprocal plot displayed inhibition mode is non-competitive and it confirms the irreversible nature of protease inhibitor. The peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3 extract showed significant anti plasmodial activity (IC50: 25.78 µg/ml). In in vivo model, the highest level of parasitemia suppression (≈ 45%) was observed in 600 mg/kg of the peptide. These analyses revealed no significant changes were observed in the spleen and liver tissue during 8 dpi. The results confirmed up-regulation of TGF-β and down regulation of TNF-α in tissue and serum level in PbA infected peptide treated mice compared to PbA infection. The results obtained infer that the peptide possesses anti- Pf activity activity. It suggests that the extracts have novel metabolites and could be considered as a potential source for drug development.	10.1371/journal.pone.0270002	9202887	Unrelated

Crenothrix  belongs to the family  Methylococcaceae  which are Type I methanotrophs that obtain their carbon and energy from methane oxidation ( Albers et al., 2015 ).  Nitrospira  is a well known nitrite-oxidizing bacteria in groundwater ( Fowler et al., 2018 ), while a recent study correlated the genus  Nordella  with Mn(II) oxidation in rapid sand filters ( Zhao et al., 2020 ). The genus  Hyphomicrobium  was proposed as a key Mn(II) oxidizer ( Albers et al., 2015 ). Organic trace contaminants can be degraded either by primary metabolism, where microorganisms utilize them as sources of carbon and possibly also nitrogen, phosphorus, or sulphur ( Alexander, 1999 ), or by co-metabolism where contaminants are transformed by enzymes without being used as an energy source ( Vickers, 2017 ). Other studies have shown that co-metabolism by methane oxidizing bacteria in rapid sand filters are relevant for degradation of the pesticide bentazone ( Hedegaard et al., 2020 ). Biological removal was only observed for gramine and sparteine and was primarily of importance at Regnemark waterworks. At Slangerup waterworks, which receives the water with highest concentrations of methane ( Table 3 ) no biological removal occurred ( Table 5 ) and thus there were no indications that methanotrophs governed the removal of phytotoxins. Further studies are needed to determine which biological process removed the phytotoxins.	Organic trace contaminants can be degraded either by primary metabolism, where microorganisms utilize them as sources of carbon and possibly also nitrogen, phosphorus, or sulphur ( Alexander, 1999 ), or by co-metabolism where contaminants are transformed by enzymes without being used as an energy source ( Vickers, 2017 ).

B32-pharmaceutics-15-02227	The issue pertains to the degradation behavior of polysaccharides in drug delivery in form of coatings could be related to the polysaccharide chemistry, their broad and/or mixed molecular weights, making it difficult to precisely define the delivery vehicle. In drug delivery systems, the particle size distribution of the carrier is impacted by the molecular weight of polysaccharides. However, controlling the molecular weight of these polysaccharides can significantly increase their preparation costs. Moreover, often polysaccharide-based drug delivery platforms require the slow enzymatic degradation of biopolymers, and there are numerous polysaccharides that cannot dissolve in most organic solvents, which also restricts the options for their chemical modification [ 7 ]. Polysaccharides used as coatings may have limited applications due to their low drug loading capacity, which can be a problem when administering a less potent drug at a high dose [ 32 ]. Achieving an accurate amount of drug in each unit dose of the film can be a challenging task, and failure to do so can lead to therapeutic failure or nonreproducible effects [ 33 ]. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest developments in polysaccharide-based coatings for drug delivery systems. First, we examine the essential characteristics of an effective drug delivery system and highlight how coatings offer numerous benefits in this regard. Then, we discuss several prominent examples of polysaccharide-based coatings, as well as various methods proposed for their characterization. We also explore the commercialization challenges associated with these coatings and provide a thorough summary of the research conducted in this field. Finally, we offer conclusions and prospects for the future of this exciting area of study.

REF5	In December 2019, scientists in Wuhan, China, separated a new RNA virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within pneumonia cases. The infection induced by this virus is named coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) [ 1 ]. The rapid outbreak of COVID-19 affected about 219 countries worldwide resulting in more than 180 million COVID-19 cases and over 3 million deaths [ 2 ]. In Saudi Arabia, 480,000 COVID-19 cases and 7,000 deaths as of the 19th of June 2021 were reported. Therefore, the outbreak of COVID-19 is a major priority for public health worldwide [ 3 ]. COVID-19 spreads mainly through close contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person or surfaces contaminated with the virus. The incubation period of the virus lasts up to 14 days in symptomatically or asymptomatically COVID-19 patients [ 4 ]. The common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, shortness of breath, dry cough, dyspnea, and decreased white blood cells [ 5 ]. Further, headache, diarrhea, anorexia, abdominal pain, sore throat, and rhinorrhea are less common symptoms of COVID-19 [ 6 ]. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic has been vast to the extent that it has wreaked havoc on the whole global community in addition to most of the health care, educational, and economic national systems [ 7 ]. Right after the announcement of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) took serious precautionary measures to promote public awareness and knowledge to limit the spread of COVID-19. Information about COVID-19 symptoms, ways of transmission, and preventive measures were the focus of all the Saudi national press and media to prevent the spread of the virus. Further public legislation, such as social distancing, face covering, and panning social gatherings in addition to providing free face masks and hand sanitizing products to the public helped greatly limit the chain of the infection [ 8 ]. Healthcare workers (HCWs) interact directly with patients, thereby at a high risk of being exposed to COVID-19. Therefore, WHO and the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have targeted the HCWs with various COVID-19 educational, training, and recommendation guidelines that have been published online [ 9 ,  10 ]. Nonetheless, the cases of COVID-19 among the HCWs are considerably high, implying the possibility of COVID-19 knowledge or practice gaps [ 11 - 13 ]. The level of COVID-19 knowledge among the HCWs has been examined in various studies that would deepen our understanding to develop further solutions [ 14 - 17 ]. Nonetheless, there is still a gap in the literature on the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs in Saudi Arabia. Thus, we aimed to assess the knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19 among the HCWs at Al-Imam Abdulrahman Al Faisal Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Such a study can provide further insight on the status of the HCWs' knowledge of COVID-19 and if more efforts are consequently required.	The common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, shortness of breath, dry cough, dyspnea, and decreased white blood cells [ 5 ].	Male moths compete to arrive first at a female releasing pheromone.

It is seen that for rGO there are two peaks, a broader peak and a small peak at 22.3° and 42.9° for the (002) and (102) planes, respectively, which are in accordance with the crystalline structure. 31  Similarly, for MWCNTs, there are two peaks, a sharp peak and a small peak at 27.4° and 44.2° for the (002) and (100) planes, respectively. It is observed that the XRD pattern of MWCNTs is more similar to that of graphite due to its intrinsic nature. 32  Similarly, the optical properties of the sensing films were studied by UV-Vis spectroscopy.  Fig. 3b  shows the UV-Vis absorption for rGO and MWCNTs. For rGO, the absorption spectrum shows a red-shift of the 235 nm peak to 290 nm because of the oxygen functional group removal and conjugate structure restoration. 33  Similarly, for MWCNTs, the absorption spectrum shows a significance peak from 210 to 295 nm. It is observed that both the absorption spectra fall in the 200 to 300 nm region, which means that these carbon materials are good candidates for use in solar cells and light sensing applications.

B71-pharmaceutics-14-01091	Nano-emulsions (NE) are non-homogeneous, transparent colloidal dispersion systems of 100 nm size that are optically isotropic and thermodynamically stable. These are comprised of water and oil followed by the addition of co-surfactant and surfactant [ 71 ]. The lipophilic drug has been entrapped into the oil droplets, both in  o / w  and  w / o  suspensions. These oil droplets were engulfed by the macrophages and found in higher amounts in the liver, spleen, and kidneys. However, hydrophilic drugs were in the aqueous phase of  w / o  or  w / o / w  nano-emulsions.  Figure 6  demonstrated different methods of NE preparation and the structure of nano-emulsions. Owing to their higher internal membrane permeability, these condensed to the lymphatic system, administered through intramuscular and subcutaneous routes [ 49 ]. The absorption of NE through the intestine has been attributed to lymphatic transport processes, resulting in amended oral bioavailability of the entrapped drugs [ 72 ]. The main characteristics of NE involve the stability of entrapped components, targeted sustained release, enhancing membrane permeability through the skin and mucous membranes, solubilizing components of different lipophilicities, improving drug absorption, lessening pain and allergy conditions, lowering viscosities, simple methods of production, and fewer chances of contamination [ 71 , 73 ]. The attractive properties of NE enabled their use as a vehicle for the distribution of essential oils, nucleic acid, drugs antimicrobial agents, repellents, and as an imaging agent [ 71 , 73 ]. In the past few eras, nano-emulsions have been amended for transdermal remedial use like phospholipids, Transcutol ® P, fatty alcohol, alkyl poly-glycosides, and PEGylated fatty acid ester [ 74 ]. Numerous nano-emulsion formulations incorporating herbal drugs like camptothecin, genistein, rutin, oils of  Brucea javanica , resveratrol, coixenolide, etc., with plenty of health benefits have been listed in the literature [ 75 , 76 ].

B71-pharmaceutics-14-01091	Phytosomes are lipid-compatible molecular complexes that encapsulate pharmacological bioactive and water-soluble phytochemicals in phospholipids, resulting in increased absorption and bioavailability [ 111 ]. Hydrophilic phytochemicals, such as polyphenols and flavonoids, have lower absorption in the body due to their high molecular size, which made absorption across biological membranes difficult. These constraints have been overcome thanks to phytosome [ 71 ]. The uniqueness associated with them includes their molecular complex and chemical bond formation between plant material and phosphatidylcholine at a ratio of either 1:1 or 1:2 [ 112 ]. Structurally, phytosomes resemble liposomes, except for the entrapment of the material. In liposomes, the active material is dissolved in the medium present in the membrane layers, while in phytosomes the active material is a vital part of the membrane ( Figure 8 ). The phytosomes created a better transition of the enterocyte cell membrane from a water-soluble to a lipid-soluble state, then inside the cell, reaching the bloodstream, and protecting entrapped herbal medications from stomach fluids and gut microorganisms. A large number of studies have been carried out to determine their use and qualities in comparison to other traditional delivery techniques. Recently, a group of researchers combined several flavonoids, including quercetin, kaempferol, and apigenin, into a single phytosome called flavonosome, which proved to be an effective antioxidant, hepatoprotective agent, and heat supplement [ 113 ].

B104-molecules-25-00828	Recently, it has been reported that boron nitride nanoparticles (BNNPs) exhibited good results in treating triple negative breast cancer in mice [ 46 ]. Since BNNPs show good biocompatibility and have high boron content capacity, they are considered as promising boron carriers. On-demand degradable boron carriers were designed and were coated by a phase-transitioned lysozyme (PTL) as shown in  Figure 6 a. The PTL protects the BNNPs from hydrolysis during blood circulation and can be readily removed by vitamin C after NCT. The report also indicated that the coated BNNPs showed high boron accumulation in the tumor while maintaining its good ratio between tumor and nontumor cells. After neutron irradiation, the tail-vein injections of vitamin C were followed, and it was found that BNNPs were rapidly cleared from major organs according to ex vivo ICP-OES analysis ( Figure 6 b). Compared with the control group, animals treated with BNCT showed suppression of tumor growth, while almost negligible side effects were observed. This strategy not only utilized the high boron content of BNNPs but also successfully performed an on-demand degradation of BNNPs to avoid the potential toxicity caused by the long-term accumulation of nanoparticles. Even high accumulation of B atoms inside the cells have been shown by these nanoparticles but they have failure in the therapeutic window for BNCT.

No DOI	Protease inhibitors from marine actinobacteria as a potential source for antimalarial compound	bib19	The transmission rate is given by  β  and the force of infection is dependent on the age-stratified contact matrix  C  ∈  R M ∗ M . Each of its elements,  C ij , indicates the average number of contacts made by a person in age group  i  with persons in age group  j  on a daily basis. As a result, we use the country-specific contact matrices supplied in Reference ( Karthik et al., 2014 ). Susceptible individuals (vaccinated and unvaccinated alike) may begin engaging in less safe behaviours as a consequence of the availability of an effective vaccine. This is mirrored in the model by a shift from compartments  S  and  V  to the new compartments  S NA  and  V NA —  NA , which signify non-adherence of individuals who take fewer measures and hence get infected at a higher rate  S NA  and  V NA  compartments contribute to the force of infection in different ways, and it adjusts this contribution. It is worth noting that this choice is highlighted in the literature because of the estimated impact of NPIs like face masks and social isolation on the propagation of COVID-19 ( Haug et al., 2020 ;  Mitze et al., 2020 ). In order to simulate the behavioural change, we suggest two processes. First, the shift from adherence to non-adherence occurs at a rate  δ  and is accelerated by the cumulative percentage of people who got a vaccination ( vt , which includes both adherent and non-adherent individuals). The opposing shift from ( S NA  and  V NA )) to ( S  and  V ) occurs at a rate of  γ , accelerated by the number of deaths per 100,000 recorded in the preceding time step ( d t − 1 o , encompassing both adherence and non-adherence). On the other hand, a constant rate  δ  is used in the second mechanism, in which  S  and  V  individuals transit to the non-adherence compartment  S NA  and  V NC . As a result, we take into consideration the potential of non-adherent individuals returning to safer behaviours at a consistent rate  γ . Taking into account and in order to prevent problems with transition probabilities greater than one, we model the rates as:  λ X → X N A  = 1 −  exp − g ( δ ) ,  λ X N A → X  = 1 −  exp − h ( γ ) , where  X  represent  S  and  V  and the exponent depends on the two procedures outlined above. Thus, the model stated above could be expressed as a system of differential equations for age group  m .

The study was planned to screen the marine actinobacterial extract for the protease inhibitor activity and its anti- Pf activity under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Out of 100 isolates, only 3 isolates exhibited moderate to high protease inhibitor activities on trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase K. Based on protease inhibitor activity 3 isolates were chosen for further studies. The potential isolate was characterized by polyphasic approach and identified as Streptomyces sp LK3 (JF710608). The lead compound was identified as peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3. The double-reciprocal plot displayed inhibition mode is non-competitive and it confirms the irreversible nature of protease inhibitor. The peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3 extract showed significant anti plasmodial activity (IC50: 25.78 µg/ml). In in vivo model, the highest level of parasitemia suppression (≈ 45%) was observed in 600 mg/kg of the peptide. These analyses revealed no significant changes were observed in the spleen and liver tissue during 8 dpi. The results confirmed up-regulation of TGF-β and down regulation of TNF-α in tissue and serum level in PbA infected peptide treated mice compared to PbA infection. The results obtained infer that the peptide possesses anti- Pf activity activity. It suggests that the extracts have novel metabolites and could be considered as a potential source for drug development.	10.1016/j.idm.2022.08.005	9391232	Unrelated

In the most recent meta-analytical study, it examined 115 independent samples from 34 countries, reporting a global gender difference where men were found to be more prone to PIU symptoms or severity compared to women [ 92 ]. Men are about five times more likely to have PIU than women [ 93 ]. A study examined the relationship between internet use and gender in 2160 Chinese adolescents and found that males have higher PIU symptoms [ 94 ]. Another study also found that men in a sample of 2059 Chinese adolescents scored significantly higher than women in PIU severity [ 95 ]. Similarly, males outperformed females in PIU severity in various cultures, including Indian [ 96 ], Vietnamese [ 97 ], British [ 98 ], Romanian [ 99 ] and Bengali [ 100 ]. In terms of specific categories of internet behaviours, study found that males more often engaged in online role-play games, file downloading, shopping, gambling, visiting pornographic websites, and indiscriminate surfing, whereas the females are more likely to engage in information searching, chatting, e-mailing, and social networking [ 101 ].

In addition, L-carnosine supplementation resulted in an increased level of HDL-C in high-fat and high-cholesterol-fed rats [ 58 ]. In our pilot study, carnosine supplementation showed beneficial effects on plasma lipidome in overweight and obese adults [ 59 ]. Here, we reported no change of lipid profile indicators after carnosine supplementation in subjects with prediabetes and T2DM with good glycemic control. This may be due to the largely normal levels of LDL-C and HDL-C at baseline. Our findings are consistent with the previous results from a systematic review and meta-analysis study [ 25 ]. This study included four RCTs showed that carnosine supplementation elicited no effect on TG, TC, and HDL-C. However, we previously showed positive effects on the plasma lipidome [ 59 ].

This is the primary condition for distinguishing target auditory data from non-target auditory data and also for normal auditory function [ 17 , 18 ]. Studies have shown that correct localization can help people with normal hearing thresholds to understand conversations with a lower SNR, and also demonstrated that auditory localization improves the SNR by 2 to 3 dB when the nature of the noise and signal are different, but increases the spatial advantage by 10 dB when the noise and signal are homogeneous [ 19 , 20 ]. When the noise and the signal have different frequency textures, the noise causes energetic masking. By contrast, when the noise and the signal of the same type coexist, e.g., target speech in the presence of distorted speech signals, the distracted noise causes both energetic and informational masking. Target signal processing in the presence of masking noises, particularly informational masking, necessitates the proper operation of cognitive mechanisms [ 21 ].

28743020	Animal communication: when i'm calling you, will you answer too?	bib15	Growing concerns about pollution and global freshwater scarcity threaten human health and ecosystems [ [1] ,  [2] ,  [3] ,  [4] ]. Of particular concern is the contamination of water and wastewater with pesticides [ 5 ], toxic dyes [ 6 , 7 ], antibiotics [ 8 ], and heavy metal ions (HMIs) [ [9] ,  [10] ,  [11] ], which has emerged as an urgent ecological crisis [ [12] ,  [13] ,  [14] ]. Industries operating in countries with inadequate or non-existent regulatory frameworks often discharge metalliferous effluents into freshwater without proper treatment. This irresponsible discharge of metalliferous wastewater contributes to the accumulation of heavy metals in water resources. In addition, human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, industrial processes, agricultural practices, and dietary habits, exacerbate this problem, resulting in adverse environmental impacts. HMI pollution adversely affects the anthroposphere's water, air, and soil components. HMIs, including lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, chromium, cobalt, selenium, nickel, copper, and zinc, are highly toxic, tend to bioaccumulate, pose severe risks to human health and natural ecosystems, and cause significant environmental problems [ 15 , 16 ]. HMIs are released into the environment through various natural processes, such as spring water, erosion, volcanic eruptions, and bacterial activity. While these HMIs are typically present in trace amounts in natural water sources, many are toxic at deficient concentrations. In addition to osteoporosis, renal damage, bronchiolitis, cardiovascular disease, and even cancer, several diseases have been proven to be associated with long-term exposure to HMIs [ 17 , 18 ]. Among these HMIs, cobalt (II) is particularly toxic, and its excessive intake has been linked to health problems, including asthma, allergies, heart failure, and damage to the liver and thyroid. To release Co (II) effluents into the environment, those effluents should be effectively purified. Various methods are employed to remove HMIs from aqueous solutions, including electrochemistry, membrane separation, ion exchange, chemical precipitation, and adsorption. The adsorption method is among the most prominent and effective techniques for removing HMIs from wastewater [ 17 , 19 , 20 ]. Researchers have reported using various adsorptive materials to treat HMIs wastewater in the last few decades, such as biomass adsorbents, inorganic minerals, activated carbon, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), polymers, and others. Surface-active functional groups and structural features of adsorbents determine their ability to absorb HMIs [ 18 , 21 , 22 ]. Through chemical or physical interaction with adsorbents, HMIs attach to their surface-active sites. There are several mechanisms by which adsorbents remove HMIs from aqueous media, including physical adsorption, electrostatic interaction, coordination interaction, and ion exchange [ 23 ]. As a result of their unique properties, specifically high porosity, large specific surface area, and tunable structure, MOFs have attracted considerable attention in recent years [ [24] ,  [25] ,  [26] ,  [27] ,  [28] ]. These properties make MOFs highly versatile for various applications, including gas storage [ [29] ,  [30] ,  [31] ], gas separation [ 32 , 33 ], catalysis [ 34 , 35 ], drug delivery [ 36 , 37 ], sensing [ [38] ,  [39] ,  [40] ], and adsorption [ 26 , [41] ,  [42] ,  [43] ,  [44] ]. The unique properties of MOFs, particularly their well-defined pores and channels, allow target compounds to access the active sites within the MOF crystals efficiently [ 45 ]. This makes MOFs a promising adsorption material with the highest performance quality in removing toxic and radioactive HMIs [ [46] ,  [47] ,  [48] ,  [49] ]. Bimetallic MOFs are a remarkable type of porous material containing two metal sources and organic ligands [ [50] ,  [51] ,  [52] ]. In particular, Co/Ni bimetallic MOFs are characterized by excellent hydrophilicity and stability [ [53] ,  [54] ,  [55] ]. Due to the promising properties of MOFs, they have emerged as potential candidates for heavy metal removal applications. Motaghi et al. investigated the adsorption performance of Co (II) in water using the bio-nanocomposite MOF MCS/AC@UiO-66 and achieved a remarkable adsorption efficiency of 44.5 % within 15 min. Wang et al. proposed microporous zeolitic imidazole framework-90, obtained by post-synthetic modifications of ZIF-90-Met and ZIF-90-Lys, for Co (II) removal. The maximum adsorption capacities of Co (II) on ZIF-90-Met and ZIF-90-Lys were reported to be 136.83 and 164.40 mg g −1 , respectively, for a period of 80 min. Yuan et al. investigated the adsorption of Co (II) from wastewater using MOFs. The synthesized MOF adsorbents, namely UiO-66-COOCH 3 , UiO-66-CONH 2 , UiO-66-CN, and UiO-66-SO 3 H, exhibited exceptional adsorption performance with saturated adsorption capacities of 334.4, 339.7, 274.6, and 293.7 mg g −1 , respectively. Moreover, Zhuo et al. synthesized ZIF-90-SO 2 HN 2 , which showed an optimal adsorption capacity of about 122.85 mg g −1  for Co (II) below specific conditions (pH = 6.72, T = 303 K, C0 = 250 mg L −1 ) (see  Fig. 1 ).

However, according to the available scientific reports, the gravitational sedimentation in the primary treatment phase is insufficient for the viral removal entirely from the sewage. The removal of coronavirus RNA through wastewater treatment operations has been seen for additional treatments comprising secondary and tertiary treatment, and tertiary treated wastewater is reused for irrigation and public domain directly [ 94 ].

B190-cells-10-03288	In contrast to the successful adoption of the GPCR biased signaling idea for therapeutic benefit in the cardiovascular, neurological, and behavior sectors, there have been no publications establishing the efficacy of GPCR biased signaling for the treatment of cancer. Recent research, however, revealed scientific advances in the possible application of biased signaling on endothelin receptors in cancer therapy. Endothelin-A receptor (ETAR) couples to Gα q , Gα s , and Gα 12/13  and is expressed mainly in vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes as well as solid tumors [ 186 , 187 , 188 ]. The activation of the ETAR by endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a key factor in the development of ovarian cancer by promoting anti-apoptosis, invasion, and neoangiogenesis [ 189 ]. Indeed, overexpression of ETAR is linked to a poor prognosis in patients with ovarian carcinoma. However, a clinical trial found that particular ETAR antagonists are no effective as a cancer therapy adjunct. This might be due to ETAR’s signaling bias, which controls both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive activities. Gα q -coupled or β-arrestin-dependent signaling pathways are known to mediate ETAR’s carcinogenic downstream effects [ 49 , 189 ]. The recruitment and nuclear translocation of β-arrestin, which in turn works as an epigenetic regulator of multiple angiogenic/metastatic genes, including β-catenin, is facilitated by GRK5/6-mediated phosphorylation of the receptor [ 49 , 190 ]. ETAR-mediated Gα s  activation, on the other hand, stimulates AC/cAMP/PKA signaling, which has been shown to limit tumor growth in numerous carcinoma-derived cell lines [ 17 , 191 , 192 ]. Because the ET-1/ETAR axis may activate both tumor suppressive and oncogenic features in cancer cells, ligands that target Gα s /cAMP/PKA signaling could be a promising new treatment option for a variety of cancers. Silencing both β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 also reduces the signaling of these receptors (e.g., ETAR), lowering Src and serine/threonine kinase AKT activation, and ultimately altering the β-catenin pathway [ 163 ]. CXCR4 overexpression and dysfunctional downstream signaling have been linked to tumor development, vascularization, and metastasis in a variety of malignancies [ 193 ]. PAR2, a GPCR with unique biased signaling, has also emerged as a possible therapeutic target for preventing breast cancer cells from quickly metastasizing [ 194 ]. As a result, the creation of novel biased ligands for CXCR4 and PAR2 might lead to new cancer therapy options.	The recruitment and nuclear translocation of β-arrestin, which in turn works as an epigenetic regulator of multiple angiogenic/metastatic genes, including β-catenin, is facilitated by GRK5/6-mediated phosphorylation of the receptor [ 49 , 190 ].

A lack of specific bacterial species from the gut microbiota among infants aged 1–3 months was linked to a higher risk of developing a recurrent wheeze, asthma, or atopy later in life, according to birth cohort studies [ 103 , 104 ]. Such changes were associated with reduced levels or a lack of anti-inflammatory polyunsaturated fatty acids [ 104 ]. Proteobacteria, especially Haemophilus spp., are more prevalent in asthmatic adults’ lungs than in healthy controls, who have a higher proportion of Bacteroidetes. Furthermore, asthmatic children have a higher abundance of Proteobacteria than healthy controls [ 105 ]. Intestinal dysbiosis in egg-allergic children was marked by an increase in the Lachnospiraceae and Streptococcaceae genera, as well as a decrease in the Leuconostocaceae families, when compared to non-food-allergic controls [ 106 ]. Ege et al. compared the microbial data of 489 school-aged children from rural and urban areas in Germany and found a number of bacteria, including Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus, and Acinetobacter, that were inversely related to asthma and hay fever [ 107 ]. When children with allergic airway diseases were compared to children from similar surrounding environments, such as both from urban areas, a mild reduction in microbiota diversity was observed, and microorganisms from the phylum Firmicutes were significantly less expressed than in healthy children [ 108 ]. A similar pattern was observed among Swedish children. At infancy, children with asthma have a lower diversity of gut microbes than children without asthma [ 109 ].

10.1371/journal.pone.0090972	Protease inhibitors from marine actinobacteria as a potential source for antimalarial compound	B21-pathogens-11-00029	CE is a cosmopolitan helminthic disease that occurs worldwide over a wide range of geographic areas associated with livestock rearing, such as Australia, eastern and southern Europe, Asia, South America, and the Middle East, and is endemic in many parts of the world, including Pakistan. Multiple socio-cultural and economic factors, as well as poor hygiene practices, are associated with higher transmission and prevalence rates of CE [ 17 , 18 , 19 ], for example, illiteracy, farming, having pets (especially dogs), and living in rural areas [ 20 ]. The prevention and control of CE are essential, as it is associated with loss of livestock and considerable economic losses. In the United States (US), annual losses of USD 3 billion were estimated to occur due to loss of wages, treatment costs, and production losses associated with livestock [ 21 ]. Further, the direct cost associated with the surgical management of CE patients amounted to USD 4,068,666, with USD 3,951,853 attributable to direct diagnosis- and treatment-related costs, and USD 117,137 attributable to wage losses during the treatment period [ 22 ]. Each year, it is predicted that 188,000 people worldwide contract E. granulosus, resulting in the loss of 184,000 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) [ 23 ]. Pakistan is considered an endemic CE region [ 24 ], but the disease burden has been poorly studied in Pakistan [ 17 ]. Thus, little is known about the disease’s epidemiology and its importance in public health [ 25 ].

Out of 100 isolates, only 3 isolates exhibited moderate to high protease inhibitor activities on trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase K. Based on protease inhibitor activity 3 isolates were chosen for further studies. The potential isolate was characterized by polyphasic approach and identified as Streptomyces sp LK3 (JF710608). The lead compound was identified as peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3. The double-reciprocal plot displayed inhibition mode is non-competitive and it confirms the irreversible nature of protease inhibitor. The peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3 extract showed significant anti plasmodial activity (IC50: 25.78 µg/ml). In in vivo model, the highest level of parasitemia suppression (≈ 45%) was observed in 600 mg/kg of the peptide. These analyses revealed no significant changes were observed in the spleen and liver tissue during 8 dpi. The results confirmed up-regulation of TGF-β and down regulation of TNF-α in tissue and serum level in PbA infected peptide treated mice compared to PbA infection. The results obtained infer that the peptide possesses anti- Pf activity activity. It suggests that the extracts have novel metabolites and could be considered as a potential source for drug development.	10.3390/pathogens11010029	8781053	Unrelated

Currently, the concentration of nitrates in fruits and vegetables are exceeding the allowed limits worldwide 2 , 3 . This has led to strict regulations regarding the allowable levels of nitrate in our food based on the assumption that nitrate is overall harmful to our health. Concerns over nitrate intake originate from the fact that they are associated with the genesis of some forms of cancer and methemoglobinemia throughout the world 4 , 5 . They react with the secondary amines in the stomach and lead to the formation of nitrosamines (N-nitroso compounds), some of which are known to be carcinogenic, teratogenic, and mutagenic. This increases the risk of cancer to the stomach and esophagus 6 – 9 . Some studies have evidence that a positive correlation exists between high nitrate consumption and gastric cancer in humans 10 , 11 . On the other hand, several plausible health benefits and preventive effects of nitrate have also been reported recently. A substantial number of studies in health and hypertensive subjects have now shown that nitrate has beneficial cardiovascular effects, including lowering of blood pressure 12 – 17 . Scientific evidence also suggests that having abundant vitamin C and polyphenol in fruits and vegetables facilitate in the nonenzymatic reduction of toxic nitrite to beneficial nitric oxide, thereby reducing the chances of nitrite reacting with secondary amines forming nitrosamines 18 , 19 . Therefore, it has been pointed out that the evidence for adverse effects of nitrate is inconsistent, and nitrate may actually be beneficial. Hence, the concepts of risk–benefit of exposure to dietary nitrate become a challenging/unresolved issue to the scientists.

Although many biogenic nanoparticles have been synthesized still there is need for nanoparticles with precise biological and chemical properties. In this regard use of plant material in the formation of nanoparticles is getting more and more attention [ 54 ,  55 ]. Many scientists used the plant material (bark, leaves, stem, roots, leaves) in the successful synthesis of silver nanoparticles [ 56 – 59 ]. In this study, the hydrothermal method has been adopted for the biogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles using  Thymus vulgaris  extract. It is the first time use of  Thymus vulagris  extract in a hydrothermal approach for the synthesis of nanoparticles. The main advantage of this method is that it can produce a bulk amount of silver nanoparticles and the efficiency of this procedure is very much high as compared to other known methods [ 60 – 62 ]. Which may perk from the economical and ecological facet. It is well documented that the use of plant extract in the synthesis of nanoparticles leads to nontoxic properties and natural capping agents [ 63 ,  64 ]. The maximum absorbance of silver nanoparticles has been observed in the UV-visible spectrum at 438 nm to 425 nm due to the surface plasmon vibration in nanoparticles, confirming their synthesis. The results presented here are in good agreement with the previous reports [ 65 – 71 ]. Additionally synthesized T/AgNPs have potential anticandidal properties. FTIR spectrum of T/AgNPs reveals the absorbance peak with variable band intensity as compared to the FTIR spectrum of plant extract [ 72 ,  73 ]. This shifting of absorbance peak may be due to the involvement of biomolecules in the reduction and stabilization of silver ions to silver (0) [ 74 – 76 ]. The HRTEM study indicates that most of the nanoparticles are almost spherical. Very few clusters have been observed that may be size variation or gathering of individual particles. Various sizes of spherical nanoparticles have been also reported in other studies by TEM analysis [ 54 ,  77 ,  78 ]. It is well known that the biogenically synthesized AgNPs using plants or microorganisms are an effective way the advancement of secure and proficient control approach against resistant bacteria [ 79 – 82 ]. Herein the potential of synthesized T/AgNPs has been determined in anticandidal activity. In this regard forty-six fungal isolates were obtained from different specimens of 60 COVID-19 inpatients; 33 were  Candida  albicans, 10  Candida non-  albicans isolates (2  Candida  famata, 4  Candida  galabrata, 2  Candida  krusei, and 2  Candida tropicalis ). It has been reported that bacteria species and fungi are considered co-infections in critically ill patients with COVID-19, which increases its morbidity and mortality15. Numerous strains of  Candida  also have been identified as unique pathogens from COVID-19 patients’ pulmonary specimens (TA, BAL as well as BAS) and recognized as a source of co-infections [ 83 ] and the frequency of fungal co-infection was significantly greater than previously reported [ 83 ].

They offer a structured framework to evaluate overall water quality and the extent of heavy metal pollution. Amid the diverse array of water quality indices, several hold notable significance in the context of heavy metal contamination assessment. Among these is the heavy metals index (MI), a parameter considering the concentrations of distinct heavy metals within water samples 12 . MI is precisely calculated to assess water resource drinkability. Heavy metal pollution index (HPI) is another way to estimate water quality based on heavy metals and their effect on human health 13 . The heavy metals evaluation index (HEI) also connects heavy metal concentrations and toxicity levels, offering insights into potential health risks 14 .

28743020	Animal communication: when I’m calling you, will you answer too?	bib16	Chlorine is considered the most Related disinfectant due to its low cost, easy availability, and persistence within the water distribution network [ 6 ]. When chlorine is added to water, chlorine is produced either as hypochlorous acid (HOCl) or hypochlorite ion (OCl‾), which interact with natural organic matter (NOM) present, such as decaying vegetation or algae, leading to the formation of numerous disinfection byproducts (DBPs) [ [7] ,  [8] ,  [9] ,  [10] ]. Factors influencing the formation of DBPs depend on the quality of the source water, including the concentration of chlorine, chlorine contact time, pH, temperature, concentrations of iodide and bromide ions (as inorganic precursors), the concentrations and characteristics of NOM (as organic precursors), and the type and material of the WDN [ 4 , 11 ]. However, in the presence of iodide and bromide ions in water, these ions can further increase the formation of brominated and iodinated THMs by reacting with NOM to create Br −  and I −  DBPs [ 10 ]. A variety of DBPs, such as trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), and halogenated acetonitriles (HANs), are formed through the reaction between chlorine and the organic matter present in raw water [ 4 , 8 , 12 ]. In drinking water networks, THMs are primarily formed during the disinfection process [ 13 ]. In surface water where bromide and iodide ions are not present, chlorinated byproducts become prevalent during disinfection using free chlorine [ [13] ,  [14] ,  [15] ,  [16] ].

10.1016/j.cub.2017.05.064	Animal communication: when I'm calling you, will you answer too?	bib193	During the processing of dark chocolate, cocoa beans undergo various stages. So, the nutrient and antioxidant content may vary from the original one to the finished product. One of the important parts of cocoa processing is roasting, which can alter the composition of Nutrients that already exist in the cocoa beans. Roasting is responsible for the characteristic taste, color, aroma, and texture ( Krysiak, 2006 ). Most of the time, 120–150 °C temperature is used for roasting and the total time taken for this process is 5–120 min. This condition exaggerates the loss of total polyphenol content and flavonoids ( Krysiak, 2011 ). The monomeric flavonols are lost during normal roasting temperature ( Vicker., 2017 ;  Ioannone et al., 2015 ). The rate of polyphenol degradation is reduced by maintaining 5% humidity during roasting. For a carbohydrate, for example, the amount of fructose and glucose is decreased, but the concentration of non-reducing sugar (stachyose, sucrose, verbascose, and raffinose) remains unaltered. In polysaccharides, approximately 10% arabinose is lost, but the overall level of pectic and hemicellulosic polymers is not changed after finishing roasting. The level of acetylation and esterification of pectic polysaccharides are not hampered by roasting. Polyphenolic compounds, polysaccharides, and Maillard products interact with each other by roasting ( Redgwell et al., 2003 ). Traditional roasting causes higher nutrient loss than oven roasting. Antioxidant capacity is lost due to the destruction of the polyphenolic compounds ( Reddy and Love, 1999 ). The high roasting temperature will increase the rate of polyphenol degradation, but sometimes it has been found that a high roasting temperature will lower the rate of polyphenol degradation due to low roasting time ( Ioannone et al., 2015 ). Catechin is one of the important thermolabile antioxidant compounds, which is partially destroyed by roasting. Flavonoid content is also decreased during fermentation, but this is entirely dependent on the type of roasting procedure chosen by the industry ( McShea et al., 2008 ). The total antioxidant capacity is reduced by 44% and 50% at a roasting temperature of 190 °C for 15 min ( Moreno et al., 2012 ). The amount of FRAP decreases by 51% and 45% at 125 and 145 °C roasting temperatures, respectively. At 125 °C the number of TRAP increases by 7%.

10.1016/j.cub.2017.05.064	Animal communication: when I'm calling you, will you answer too?	bib193	On the other hand, the duration of fermentation also plays an important role. On the 3rd day of fermentation, the total protein content does not differ from the raw one, but after 6 days of fermentation, this value is getting higher, while on the 9th and 12th days, the value is less than the raw content. The mineral content also differs from the original cocoa bean to dry matter. After 12 days of fermentation, the amount of inorganic phosphate varies from 201.0 to 102.0 mg/100 g. But the level of calcium increased from 29.2 mg/100 g to 60.4 mg/100 g ( Aremu et al., 1995 ). The total lipid content is starting to decrease from day 3 of fermentation and the loss is getting significant from the 6th to day 9th onwards. Ash content is also lowered from the 6th day to the 9th day. The amount of crude fiber loss is also inversely related to the length of fermentation time. The antioxidant content of under-fermented cocoa beans is much higher and has an astringent flavor ( McShea et al., 2008 ). The combined effect of heat (50 °C) and acid leads to the breakdown of cocoa seeds. During a time of fermentation process, several organic acids are generated. Phosphoric, oxalic, malic, and succinic acids are the organic acids that are responsible for the breakdown of cotyledons. This imparts the characteristic flavor of the chocolate, but the fermentation step is an uncontrolled and nonsterile process. Some variables interfere with the final flavor of chocolate. Mold colonization sometimes negatively affects the characteristics and flavor of chocolate. The composition and concentration of the flavan-3-ols and procyanidins are altered during the time of fermentation. According to several researchers' observations, fermented cocoa beans contain a higher amount of antioxidants with astringent flavor. The type of colonization and length of fermentation also result in the breakdown of flavonol content. Anthocyanin is an essential antioxidant component present in raw beans, but this content is reduced in fermented cocoa beans due to polymerization and hydrolysis of condensed tannin ( Djikeng et al., 2018 ;  Moreno et al., 2012 ). 20–40% reduction of total antioxidant capacity was observed during fermentation. Antioxidant capacity was measured by DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP ( Vickers, 2017 ;  Mattia et al., 2013 ). Recently one of the simplest and easiest methods of fermentation was found which was utilized in the formulation of kombucha tea by using SCOBY gel (Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast). It can be used for the fermentation of cocoa beans because polyphenols and antioxidant properties will be enriched after fermentation. The addition of SCOBY gel will increase the polyphenol and antioxidant content of dark chocolate. The addition of SCOBY gel will increase the polyphenol and antioxidant content of dark chocolate ( Permatasari et al., 2021 ,  2022a ,  2022b ).

B13-biosensors-12-00733	Nutrition conversion, which comprises a transformation from consumption of conventional to modern foods containing low nutrient diversity and high-energy density, is linked to the developed metabolic syndromes. The human diet is the composition of various elements containing non-nutrients and nutrients, providing the raw materials and driving several metabolic reactions in every body cell [ 1 , 2 ]. These elements and their metabolites also regulate the gene expression and functioning of cellular activities through different mechanisms. Among all the components, some of them show positive and negative effects. Researchers have studied that constant interruption in energy homeostasis or/and nutrient metabolism may occur due to the excess or deficiency of nutrients, which initiate cellular stress and lead to tissue damage and metabolic deregulations, and ultimately result in the development of metabolic syndromes [ 3 , 4 , 5 ]. Presently, it is evident that metabolism is affected by external reasons such as environment and food; internal reasons such as gene variations, gender, and age; and microbiota contact, that jointly mutate the threat of developing acquired metabolic sicknesses and various health issues in humans as shown in  Figure 1 . The gut microbiota has recently gained attention as it has affected human health significantly by living inside the human intestine. Accumulating evidence suggests that under normal circumstances, the gut microbiota has played a fundamental role in maintaining good human health in various aspects and also maintaining a mutualistic symbiotic relationship in which both benefit one another (eubiosis) [ 6 , 7 ]. Either way, the change in gut microbiota composition has shown an association with human diseases, which remains a critical area of investigation for many researchers. Various metabolites are being produced by gut microbiota from nutrients of dietary sources such as trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), trimethyl-amine (TMA), indole derivatives, nicotinamide, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), that contribute to human diseases substantially, such as metabolic diseases and cardiovascular diseases [ 8 , 9 ], cancer and inflammation [ 10 ], depression [ 11 ], and colorectal cancer [ 12 ]. Some metabolites generated from the gut microbiome, including butyrate, propionate, and SCFAs such as acetate, have shown critical roles in human health and are considerably associated with kidney diseases, hypertension, and inflammatory bowel diseases [ 13 , 14 ]. The research in the field of gut metabolite advises that these could be used as a prognostic and diagnostic marker for numerous human diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular, colorectal cancer (CRC), etc. [ 15 ]. The fast and cost-effective diagnosis of gut disease at the earliest stage raises challenges for patients, health institutions, and governments for efficient clinical results. It is also becoming clear that consuming diets rich in nutrient diversity and low in energy density may enhance and maintain good health.

B38-molecules-27-04773	The semicircles in the curve are called Cole–Cole semicircles, and each semicircle represents a Debye relaxation process of the material. Both NMO and NCMO have multiple semicircles, indicating that they both have Debye relaxation processes. In addition, the Cole–Cole semicircle of NCMO and NMO is irregular, which means that in addition to Debye relaxation, other dielectric loss mechanisms, such as electron polarization and dipole polarization, should also be considered. The interface between NiO, Ni, and Co 3 O 4  nanoparticles resulted in interface polarization due to charge aggregation. In general, magnetic losses include natural resonance, eddy current loss, exchange resonance, domain wall resonance, and hysteresis loss. When the value C 0  ( C 0 =   u ″ u ′ − 2 f − 1 ) does not vary with frequency, that is, the magnetic loss mainly originates from the eddy current loss [ 37 ]. As shown in  Figure 6 c, the C 0  curve of NCMO is closer to a straight line, and the value of C 0  does not change significantly with increasing frequency, indicating that eddy current loss is the dominant mechanism of magnetic loss [ 38 ]. In order to further evaluate the microwave absorption capacity of the material, the attenuation constant is obtained through the electromagnetic parameters, and the calculation equation is as follows [ 39 ]: (4) α = 2 π f c μ ″   ε ″ −   μ ′   ε ′ +   u ″   ε ″ −   u ′   ε ′ 2 +   u ′   ε ″ +   u ″   ε ′ 2	As shown in  Figure 6 c, the C 0  curve of NCMO is closer to a straight line, and the value of C 0  does not change significantly with increasing frequency, indicating that eddy current loss is the dominant mechanism of magnetic loss [ 38 ].

[ 64 ], the sustainability criteria of pandemic-resistant residential buildings were evaluated in three sections: Safety and health, Consumption of Natural and Environmental Resources, and Comfort. The opinions of various experts and stakeholders were analyzed to weigh the pandemic-resistant sustainability indicators using the Dotmocracy method. This is a collaborative decision-making technique that allows stakeholders and experts to vote on priorities and rank desired items in order of priority from highest to lowest. This study also points out that building sustainability assessment tools can vary by country and geographic area [ 65 ]. For instance, water resources management and water quality are more important for countries of Central Asia than for European countries or the United States [ 66 ]. After analyzing the final votes of the stakeholders and analyzing the data, it was concluded that the health and safety section has higher importance compared to other sectors. The criteria for preventing the spread of the virus, residents' psychic health, and indoor air quality were selected as the most important subsets of the health and safety sections [ 26 ]. In another paper by Saeed Kamranfar [ 67 ], the discussion revolves around analyzing green construction development barriers using a hybrid decision-making method based on DEMATEL and ANP. This approach integrates DEMATEL's capacity to identify causal relationships among factors and ANP's capability to model interdependencies in complex decision networks. Through paired comparisons, experts evaluate the relationships and influences among different barriers such as economic, managerial, social, cultural, and knowledge-related obstacles to green construction development. This method enables a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between various factors affecting the implementation of green buildings, providing insights into effective strategies to overcome these barriers and promote sustainable construction practices. Moreover, the study underscores the importance of considering specific context, climate, and regional characteristics in devising strategies for green construction development, highlighting the significance of tailored approaches to address local challenges and foster sustainability in construction projects. Additionally, the paper contributes to methodological advancements by proposing modifications to the traditional DEMATEL-ANP approach, streamlining the questionnaire process, and enhancing the model's accuracy and efficiency, thereby improving its applicability in practical decision-making contexts within the construction industry.

B24-pharmaceuticals-14-00707	Nanotechnology revolves around some common nanostructures, no matter what field or area of application is concerned. Some of the important ones are nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, dendrimers, nanoprobes, quantum dots, nano-diamonds, and nanowires ( Table 1 ). Nanoparticles possess unique characteristics and their strikingly small size makes them able to cross microscopic pores and membranes easily. Nanoparticles are broadly classified into five categories, including metal, lipid, ceramic, polymeric, and semi-conductor NPs. Metal NPs are made out of metal precursors. These in particular have unique optoelectrical properties [ 19 ]. Ceramic NPs are inorganic and nonmetal NPs are found in amorphous, polycrystalline hollow and dense forms [ 20 ]. They are efficient catalysts and help in the photodegradation of dyes and imaging technologies [ 21 ]. Semiconductor NPs have properties of both metal and non-metal NPs; hence, they also find applications in numerous fields such as photo-optics and electronic devices [ 22 , 23 ]. Polymeric NPs are organic NPs, which are either matrix particles—that are generally solid which can adhere to molecules to be transported—or are encapsulated within the particle [ 24 ]. Lipid NPs contain moieties that are lipid in nature. These are usually spherical in shape and diameters range from 10 to 100 nm. They have a solid lipid core and lipophilic molecules can be transported easily.

Hair follicles are a therapeutic target for regulating hair development [ 225 ]. The hair follicle is one avenue for drug transportation through the skin [ 226 ]. The degree of substance penetration relies on the density of follicles in each region of the skin. Hair follicles distribute topically administered chemicals. Lipid-based nanocarriers can be used for HF drug delivery and treatment of alopecia. Due to their chemical composition, lipid carriers offer an advantage for HF targeting and have been explored extensively [ 227 ]. Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) [ 201 ], liposomes [ 202 ], transferosomes [ 228 ], niosomes [ 229 ], and ethosomes [ 230 ] have been created to enhance the skin permeability of active compounds [ 231 ]. Smaller nanoparticles reveal larger depths of penetration by accumulating in hair follicles, facilitating medication administration at the capillary bulb. Particles of 200 nm size are better for medication delivery to the hair follicle isthmus [ 232 ]. When particle size reduces, surface area and dissolution rate increase, impacting the pharmacokinetic profile (accumulation area, release and distribution, metabolic transformation, etc.). Solid lipid nanoparticles containing minoxidil showed superior skin accumulation compared with commercial solutions [ 233 ]. The chemical structure of nano lipid carriers is important for drug distribution. NLC were created to overcome several possible limitations of SLN, such as its poor loading capacity and particle stability due to its high water content. SLN forms crystalline networks [ 100 ], causing drug leakage [ 234 ]. Wang et al. (2017) developed minoxidil-loaded NLC and SLN for topical alopecia therapy. MXD-NLC displayed a more prominent penetration and retention profile than MXD-SLN, minoxidil was released more quickly from NLC than SLN, and skin irritation tests revealed no erythema [ 201 ]. NLCs were loaded with clobetasol propionate in another investigation [ 235 ]. Finasteride-loaded NLCs have high physical and chemical storage stability [ 236 ] due to oleic acid. Oleic acid promotes an amorphous form in the solid lipid matrix, which lowers particle crystallinity and results in a high encapsulation efficiency [ 237 ].

They participate in mRNA degradation and gene silencing, impacting germline development and stem cell regulation ( Hutvágner and Zamore, 2002 ;  Hatfield et al., 2005 ;  Thomson and Lin, 2009 ;  Giani et al., 2011 ).

Studies on sea urchin have highlighted their role in spine and tube foot regeneration, indicating multipotent progenitor cells’ involvement ( Juliano et al., 2006 ;  Karthik et al., 2014 ;  Bodnar and Coffman, 2016 ).	The study was planned to screen the marine actinobacterial extract for the protease inhibitor activity and its anti- Pf activity under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Out of 100 isolates, only 3 isolates exhibited moderate to high protease inhibitor activities on trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase K. Based on protease inhibitor activity 3 isolates were chosen for further studies. The potential isolate was characterized by polyphasic approach and identified as Streptomyces sp LK3 (JF710608). The lead compound was identified as peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3. The double-reciprocal plot displayed inhibition mode is non-competitive and it confirms the irreversible nature of protease inhibitor. The peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3 extract showed significant anti plasmodial activity (IC50: 25.78 µg/ml). In in vivo model, the highest level of parasitemia suppression (≈ 45%) was observed in 600 mg/kg of the peptide. These analyses revealed no significant changes were observed in the spleen and liver tissue during 8 dpi. The results confirmed up-regulation of TGF-β and down regulation of TNF-α in tissue and serum level in PbA infected peptide treated mice compared to PbA infection. The results obtained infer that the peptide possesses anti- Pf activity activity. It suggests that the extracts have novel metabolites and could be considered as a potential source for drug development.	10.3389/fcell.2024.1440091	11374967	Unrelated

B294	Neuroinflammation induced by prolonged stimulation of glial cells and microglia is linked to neurodegenerative disorders. Various BV components, such as PLA2 and apamin, have been investigated as anti-neuroinflammation medicines to boost the efficiency of multiple treatments against neurodegenerative illnesses ( Mohammadi-Rad et al., 2019 ). It has been proposed that melittin might help address neurodegenerative disorders linked to stimulation of microglial cells since it substantially inhibits BV2 microglia’s pro-inflammatory activities ( Zhang et al., 2024 ). The progressive neurodegenerative illness amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) damages motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, resulting in muscle weakening and atrophy ( Zarei et al., 2015 ). Yang et al. found that melittin therapy enhances the anti-inflammatory ability of the proteasome in the central nervous system (CNS) of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) model mice ( Yang et al., 2011 ). Melittin-treated mice demonstrate less neuronal loss in the spinal cord and better motor control, which enhances motor performance. In addition, melittin therapy lowers p38 phosphorylation and the microglial cells count in the brainstem and spinal cord. Furthermore, melittin inhibits-synuclein post-transcriptional modification, a critical ALS pathogenic pathway, and activates chaperones to prevent protein misfolding. The findings support melittin’s anti-neuroinflammatory properties. Although the CNS is the major issue with ALS, the liver, spleen, and lungs are all impacted. In an animal model of ALS, melittin therapy lowers inflammation while increasing, suggesting cell viability in the spleen and lung ( Lee and Bae, 2016a ). AD, the most common neurodegenerative disease, comprises several pathogenic mechanisms that contribute to its development ( Vickers, 2017 ). Although the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease is still unknown, research suggests that inflammatory reactions may play an important part. In its progression ( Cummings et al., 2018 ). Current therapies for cognitive loss caused by Alzheimer’s disease include acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors and muscarinic or nicotinic receptor ligands. As an alternative strategy, bvPLA2 was shown to be effective in slowing the course of Alzheimer’s disease in transgenic mice. This is attributed to. bvPLA2’s capacity to minimize accumulation while improving cognitive function in mice brains. It also reveals that bvPLA2 can enhance brain glucose metabolism and lower the hippocampus’s neuroinflammatory reactions, potentially inhibiting AD progression ( Ye et al., 2016b ). Recent research has also shown that bvPLA2 therapy in a 3xTg-AD mouse model might affect regulatory T-cell populations. To prevent AD’s unfavorable inflammatory response, scientists developed a novel therapeutic method that combines bvPLA2 medication with AB vaccine therapy ( Baek et al., 2018 ). In addition to creating protective benefits against inflammatory disorders, bPLA2 possesses anti-inflammatory actions, as previously stated ( Palm et al., 2013 ). A recent study investigated PD in mice using a combination of 78% bPLA2 and 15% melittin ( Carpena et al., 2020 ). bPLA2 reduced inflammation by activating Treg cells. Additionally, bPLA2 activation reduced the loss of dopaminergic cells ( Kim KH. et al., 2019 ).

For the first method, the authors detected fake news using a combination of a pretrained BERT model and a multilayer perceptron model to capture both the textual features and metadata of tweets. For the second method, the author used a GCN with nine extracted features at each node, such as page rank, hub, and authority, for content-based fake news detection. After implementing the two methods, the authors proved that the performance of the first approach is better than that of the second. Thus, metadata play a significant role in fake news detection. Therefore, improving the efficiency of fake news detection by extracting metadata features for GCN should be considered in the future. Regarding COVID-19 and 5G conspiracies, Pehlivan  [194]  introduced structure-based fake news detection to evaluate the performance of existing models. Unlike other methods, the author used only the temporal features of networks without considering textual features. Two state-of-the-art models were selected to evaluate the GCN and DGCN  [205] . Additionally, the authors used their temporal features to test the multivariate long short-term memory fully convolutional network method  [206] . Node feature matrices of the GCN and DGCN are created based on the following values: degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, load centrality, harmonic centrality, #cliques, clustering coefficient, square clustering coefficient, and average neighbor degree. The node feature matrix of the multivariate long short-term memory fully convolutional network is created with the average clustering coefficient, #graph cliques, #connected components, local efficiency, #isolates, and normalized time distance to the source tweet. Li et al.  [191]  introduced a propagation-based method for determining political perspective by focusing on the social contextual information of news. In this study, the GCN is used with an adjacency matrix to capture and represent the social context via feature extractions: sharing actions, following actions regarding political news, and a node feature matrix are used to capture the hidden content of news via word embeddings. Meyers et al.  [153]  showed the significant role of propagation features in fake news detection models. The authors first constructed a propagation graph to present important information and then used a random forest classifier to train the graph and create node embeddings. Finally, the GCN model was used to predict the authenticity of tweets. Unlike other propagation graphs, the authors constructed the following graph: Let  G = { V , E }  denote the propagation graph, where  V  is a set of nodes including tweet nodes and retweet nodes and  E  is a set of edges connected between a tweet node and its retweet node with a time weight. Thus, this propagation graph includes a set of subgraphs, where each subgraph includes a tweet node and its retweet nodes, and its depth never exceeds 1.

These adhesives, although having advanced mechanical and physical properties, present important disadvantages from an economic and environmental point of view [ 9 , 10 ]. Economically, petroleum is increasingly seen as a risky supply source due to the unpredictability of the petrochemical industry, which may lead to a sudden increase in the price of the material, reflected in the production costs of the adhesive. Environmentally, fossil-based products influence the health of living species and contribute to air, soil, and water pollution [ 9 , 11 , 12 , 13 ]. Therefore, an increased requirement of industries and manufacturers to produce and use bio-based adhesives obtained from different natural resources is observed, aiming to decrease the harmful effects of fossil-based petroleum products.

Out of the proteins of COVID-19, the spike protein made of S-Glycoprotein has binding capability with human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2 ) [ [20] ,  [21] ] opening the development of biosensor using ACE 2  for efficient and rapid virus detection. In this direction, interdigital electrodes play a pivotal role by using as a capacitance or impedance biosensor for chemical and biochemical sensing [ 22 , 23 ]. The IDE biosensors have already been used for detection SARS-COV-2 antibodies [ 23 , 24 ], but the use of ACE2 and graphene in biosensor make the device expensive and not disposal. In this direction, phytochemicals extracted through green synthesis from citrus fruits are pivotal to make the device disposal due to having chemical interaction between S-glycoprotein and photochemicasn obtained by using molecular docking between S-protein of SARS-COV-2 with plant extract phytochemicals [ 25 ]. Their potential use of phytochemicals such as hesperidin, emodin, Chrysin, Luteolin, Genistein are already established in drug design [ 26 ].

It has received a lot of attention worldwide due to its toxicological effect. In aquatic environments, its presence can be attributed to various sources such as surface weathering, underground deposits of arsenic-rich geological sources, biological activities, volcanic emissions, and anthropogenic activities [ 1 ]. Arsenic compounds are used in various industries, such as herbicide/pesticide production, mining operations, semiconductor manufacturing, and wood preservation. Arsenic (As) concentration in the environment has risen above a WHO-permissible level, which causes long-term mutilation, and about 250 million people worldwide have been affected by its toxicity [ 2 , 3 ]. As exposure can result in significant health problems such as cardiovascular illnesses, neurological disorders, hematological impacts, and lung, bladder, kidney, and liver malignancies. In 2001, the USEPA and the WHO decreased the permissible limit of As in fresh water from 50 ug/L to 10 ug/L [ 4 ]. To minimize the toxic effects of As on humans, it is necessary to monitor the quantity of As in the environment [ 5 ]. Several analytical methods have been reported for the elimination and quantification of As, such as GF-AAS [ 6 ], AFS [ 7 ], and ICP-OES [ 8 ]. ICP-MS [ 9 ], GC [ 10 ], HPLC [ 11 , 12 ], and CE [ 13 ], coprecipitation [ 14 ], and solvent extraction techniques (liquid-liquid extraction and dispersive liquid-solid phase sorbent-based extraction).

The occurrence of inorganic arsenic in groundwater is predominantly in the nonionic trivalent (As(III)) and ionic pentavalent (As(V)) forms, with varying proportions depending on the environmental conditions of the aquifer [ 103 ]. Determining arsenic speciation in water is commonly regulated by factors such as redox conditions, pH, biological activity, and adsorption reactions [ 104 – 106 ]. Under low Eh conditions, arsenic is transformed into its As(III) form, whereas under high Eh conditions, As(V) is the predominant arsenic species. According to research, As(III) is more hazardous than As(V) and poses a challenge in terms of its elimination from water using conventional methods [ 107 , 108 ]. Typically, the elimination of As(III) involves an initial oxidation to As(V), followed by the removal of As(V) through adsorption, precipitation, or ion exchange techniques [ 10 ]. The environment is exposed to organic arsenic species, specifically monomethyl arsenic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), primarily as a result of agricultural and industrial practices [ 11 ]. MMA and DMA are active constituents in weed control and defoliation agents frequently employed before cotton harvesting. These constituents have been identified as problematic pollutants in groundwater at locations where pesticide manufacturing and inappropriate disposal practices have been carried out, as per previous research [ 12 ]. The methylation process of inorganic arsenic has been suggested as a potential biological mechanism for detoxification. However, recent studies have revealed that methylated arsenic species can induce DNA damage, chromosomal aberrations, and tumor promotion in rodents [ 13 , 14 ]. Although natural waters are primarily composed of inorganic species, the occurrence of MMA and DMA has also been documented in the literature [ 12 , 15 ].

Using the threshold of 0.4, the viral components were classified into antigens and non-antigens (scores below the threshold) using the VaxiJen server. For accurate component selection, the protegenicity (protective antigen nature), the localization, and transmembrane helices of the protein sequences were further determined 29 , 97 . This process ascertains the suitability of candidate vaccine selection for experimental validation in the vaccine development process by ensuring that the vaccines do not contain transmembrane helix regions (to ease their expression) and the proteins must not share homology with human proteins to escape the potentiality of causing autoimmune response 98 – 100 . All the proteins (GPC, NP, and L) have high protegenicity scores and are all localised in the cytoplasm with only NP predicted to have a high adhesive probability among the three proteins with no transmembrane helix.

10.1007/s10900-017-0360-5	Parents' expectations of high schools in firearm violence prevention	B98	ChatGPT has passed the theoretical component of the US medical licensing examination despite needing additional training or in-depth medical education (Au Yeung et al.,  2023 ). But employing ChatGPT and other AI technologies in medical writing raises moral and legal concerns, like the need for transparency in AI-generated work and potential copyright breaches. Even though ChatGPT has a lot of promise to improve patient-centered care in radiology and other medical disciplines, more investigation is needed to determine whether it has any disadvantages. Inaccurate statements and possibly dangerous outcomes have all been reported. Therefore, it is essential to consider the limitations of ChatGPT and other foundation models, mainly when used in the medical sector (Wen and Wang,  2023 ). The usage of ChatGPT as an embodied conversational agent in a social VR platform illustrates the potential of integrating external frameworks into social VR to create new sorts of collaborative experiences (Numan et al.,  2023 ). It demonstrates how adaptable ChatGPT is as a tool for improving user experiences across various scenarios. In the future, ChatGPT will be highly beneficial in mental health. Participants in a study conducted by the mental health software start-up Koko had access to a therapeutic conversational experience where they could talk to ChatGPT about their mental health issues (Grodniewicz and Hohol,  2023 ). Chatbots can also offer services and information in public health, such as helping smokers quit (Ogilvie et al.,  2022 ). ChatGPT can deliver individualized and accurate medical information, leading to fewer errors and complications, improved patient outcomes, greater patient involvement, and more affordable healthcare delivery (Li et al.,  2023 ). However, to assess the efficacy of ChatGPT in medicine, more research is required because the examined reports need to be of better quality. Despite this, the usage of ChatGPT in the medical industry has a lot of potential. Future research should thoroughly document its functionality, distribution strategies, and theoretical underpinnings (Payton et al.,  2017 ).	Despite this, the usage of ChatGPT in the medical industry has a lot of potential.

Firearm violence remains a significant problem in the US (with 2787 adolescents killed in 2015). However, the research on school firearm violence prevention practices and policies is scant. Parents are major stakeholders in relation to firearm violence by youths and school safety in general. The purpose of this study was to examine what parents thought schools should be doing to reduce the risk of firearm violence in schools. A valid and Related questionnaire was mailed to a national random sample of 600 parents who had at least one child enrolled in a public secondary school (response rate = 47%). Parents perceived inadequate parental monitoring/rearing practices (73%), peer harassment and/or bullying (58%), inadequate mental health care services for youth (54%), and easy access to guns (51%) as major causes of firearm violence in schools. The school policies perceived to be most effective in reducing firearm violence were installing an alert system in schools (70%), working with law enforcement to design an emergency response plan (70%), creating a comprehensive security plan (68%), requiring criminal background checks for all school personnel prior to hiring (67%), and implementing an anonymous system for students to report peer concerns regarding potential violence (67%). Parents seem to have a limited grasp of potentially effective interventions to reduce firearm violence.	10.3389/frai.2023.1237704	10644239	Unrelated

The foremost evidence of the SARS-CoV-2 presence in the water bodies and the wastewater was found in Australia, Czech Republic, Netherland, Ecuador, Nicaragua, India, and The US ( Ahmed et al., 2020 ;  Mlejnkova et al., 2020 ;  Medema et al., 2020 ;  Guerrero-Latorre et al., 2020 ;  Vammen and Guillen, 2020 ;  Kumar et al., 2020 ;  Sherchan et al., 2020 ). Further, the human wastewater samples were collected on February 17, 2020 from Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (Netherlands) for the virus analysis and results confirmed the presence of viral RNA with the help of quantitative RT-PCR technique, after 4 days when the first coronavirus case was identified in the Netherlands on February 27, 2020. Probably, the virus was excreted by the pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic, and symptomatic carriers passing through the airport.  Lodder and de Roda Husman (2020)  stated the existence of viral fragments of SARS-Cov-2 in the samples of human wastewater, collected from the Netherland. Current researches have revealed that the prevalence of SARS-Cov-2 in human body with a suitable environment could be up to several weeks after exiting the human body. Therefore, the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater can be investigated by testing, and also COVID-19 can be traced through sewage pipelines. Thus, based on these facts, the availability of hygienic conditions, safe drinking water, and sanitation should be ensured for the protection of human health during the outbreaks of COVID-19. The management of waste and applied water practices are of prime importance to limit the transmission of pandemic disease. Screening of the suspected infectious persons remained a challenging exercise in the medical field. Nonetheless, clinical screening tests were not recommended for mass surveillance. The testing technique was not only expensive and time-wasting, it can infect the individuals who are dealing with this. Therefore, the conventional diagnostic testing should be increased by following pool sample analysis. Moreover, there is a need to discover an effective approach that could be used to investigate the potential spread of the pandemic. Feces and urine excreted from the infected carriers should be managed properly as it can pose a potential risk of aerosol generation, subsequently spreading the virus in atmosphere. The entrance of SARS-CoV-2 into waste treatment system via feces and urine of the infected patients should be monitored. A decentralized system could reduce the virus load and transmission in the environment. Moreover, portable devices should be installed to disinfect the drinking water, which will be useful to reduce the waterborne infection caused by the virus. UV-based, light-emitting diode can be used for the disinfection of decentralized systems. In those places where a separate urine disposal infrastructure has been introduced, more disinfectant should be added to disinfect the urine waste. If SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers are identified in the beginning in the wastewater of a community, precautionary measures should be taken to limit the movement of native inhabitants to stop the blowout of the virus to the neighboring communities. Physical actions (grit chambers, screening), followed by biological and physiochemical treatments should be used to remove the viruses from wastewater streams. In the physical actions, viruses are adsorbed onto the suspended solids which can then be settled via gravitational sedimentation. However, the adsorption technique does not result in the complete removal of the virus from the wastewater. Therefore, secondary (bioreactor, activated sludge, and aerated biological processes) and tertiary (chlorination, performic acid, ultraviolet radiations, ozonation, and nanomaterials) treatments should be employed where necessary ( Vickers, 2017 ;  Gerba and Pepper, 2019 ;  Randazzo et al., 2020a ,  2020b ;  Teymoorian et al., 2021 ).

B56	Zinc acquisition and homeostasis contribute significantly toward bacterial physiology and pathogenesis ( Nairz et al., 2010 ;  Ammendola et al., 2016 ). This homeostasis is crucial not only for the expression of metallozymes ( Hood and Skaar, 2012 ) and other proteins related to bacterial metabolism but also for the adequate expression of virulent factors to cause infection ( Waldron and Robinson, 2009 ;  Vickers, 2017 ). Among micronutrients like copper, zinc, manganese, and iron, maintaining the intracellular and extracellular levels of zinc is of utmost importance for the structural and catalytic regulation of various bacterial proteins involved in processes like DNA replication and oxidative stress response ( Cerasi et al., 2013 ). This regulation is achieved by zinc efflux and influx transporters like P1B-type ATPase ZntA and ZnuABC in  E. coli , respectively ( Hazan et al., 2001 ;  Wei and Fu, 2006 ;  Romiguier and Roux, 2017 ). Zinc serves as a crucial bridge between bacterial metabolism and defense mechanisms against the host in  Salmonella  by ZnuABC, a zinc uptake transporter. Zn metal has a provident impact on the regulation of the protein structure and function due to its strong affinity toward amino acid residues, especially cysteine ( Tainer et al., 1991 ;  Giles et al., 2003 ). Zn metal–cysteine complexes have multifaceted functions like the inhibition of enzymatic activity in dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH-1) ( Maret, 2013a ), function as a redox switch in betaine–homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) ( Maret, 2005 ), and act as a stabilizing bridge between protein complexes like in endothelial NOS isoform (NOS3) ( Fischmann et al., 1999 ).

Both acute and chronic lung injury disrupts the iron regulatory state in the lungs [ 56 ]. Alterations in oxygen saturation levels (hypoxia and hyperoxia) change the iron metabolic process and damage the lungs because the organs are very vulnerable to metal-related oxidative stress [ 55 ]. In lung injury, serious hypoxemia, elevated endothelial and epithelial permeability, high cytokine concentrations in the lungs, and alveolar neutrophil infiltration are observed [ 57 ]. ARDS is characterized by lung damage through endothelial activation as well as capillary membrane damage leading to a leak of proteins [ 58 ]. Iron can intensify this inflammatory lung injury through the combination of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide from ARDS with the ability of iron for catalyzing more toxic ROS [ 55 ]. Elevated serum ferritin is linked to ARDS progression[ 59 ]. After an increase in iron levels, ferritin enhances isolating reactive iron. Also, the production of ferritin (an acute reactive protein) is increased in the inflammatory response, which is owing to high tissue destruction and lysis [ 59 ]. Lavage fluid from ARDS patients has exhibited a high concentration of total and non-heme iron and also cellular content of transferrin and ferritin [ 60 ], indicating disrupted pulmonary iron homeostasis in ARDS [ 55 ].

CR56	Several COVID-19 patients with high plasma ferritin levels (> 300 µg/l) had a nine-fold further chance of death prior to discharge [ 7 ]. Hyperferritinemia is an index of the “hyperferritinemia syndromes” and occurred in severe COVID-19. Hyperferritinemia syndromes characterize many autoimmune diseases [ 61 ] and because of its immunomodulatory effects possibly play a pathogenic role. High circulating ferritin displays an acute phase response and is crucial to inflammation [ 56 ]. Ferritin is a crucial iron storage protein in the cell that has two subunits of H and L and their ratio are different by tissue type and cell physiological status. [ 62 ]. The origin of ferritin in the inflammatory state is unknown but in-vitro studies indicated that it is secreted by hepatocytes[ 63 ] and macrophages through the non-conventional pathway [ 64 ] which indicates the possible effect of ferritin elevation via macrophage activation in “hyperferritinemic syndromes” [ 3 ]. Also, in ARDS ferritin serum levels are associated with disease activity and also macrophage activation. a cohort study on 39 COVID-19 patients with elevated blood ferritin concentration showed a significant correlation with disease severity [ 51 ]. The death of hepatic cells is another main trait of a high level of serum ferritin in addition to its secretion during an inflammatory response. Following secretion, serum ferritin loses part of its iron content, leading to increased amounts of free iron[ 65 ]. The excess free iron in severe inflammatory conditions is deteriorative of the inflammatory reaction and especially induces a marked pro-coagulant state [ 65 ]. Coronavirus can display effects similar to hepcidin, resulting in high ferritin levels independent of the inflammatory reaction and increased risk of coagulation [ 66 ].

B98-plants-12-03982	A study conducted by [ 91 ] demonstrated that foliar application of methyl jasmonate resulted in a significant enhancement of critical enzyme activities, including glutathione and catalase, within Brassica species. Thus, JA inhibited the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production under drought stress. It is not obvious how methyl jasmonates act to modify or alter the antioxidant mechanisms of Brassica or other plants. However, it might be possible that JA could modify gene transcriptions, translations, and post-transcriptional changes. However, JA is certainly responsible for changing the metabolic reactions at the cellular level in plants. Methyl jasmonate could also justify the water potential in plant cells. This all is interconnected with the regulation of JA production because it has a major role in drought stress coping in plants where it stimulates the plant metabolic machinery to produce secondary metabolites like different proteins, solutes, etc. One of these solutes is proline which has a key role in combating drought stress in plants [ 22 , 52 , 54 ]. Another study [ 94 ] reported that an exogenous spray of JA greatly improved the production of proline under drought conditions and this proline made barley plants capable of coping with drought conditions by producing more water potential and defensive proteins. Jasmonic acid also adjusted glutathione and ascorbate metabolism activities in  Agropyron cristatum  leaves under drought stress conditions [ 8 , 95 ]. There are also important roles of JA when it is applied exogenously or produced endogenously. When JA is produced it promptly stimulates the production of growth hormones or regulators. The exogenous foliar application of JA induces the synthesis of Abscisic acid (ABA) through a metabolic interconnection, thereby promoting ABA production in other research, it is observed that JA production could have an initiator effect on ethylene biosynthesis in many plants [ 51 , 96 , 97 ]. It suggests that with the production of JA, ethylene is also produced. So, JA has a synergistic effect like it is interlinked with the other growth hormones and regulators ( Figure 5 ). In other research, it was found that by applying JA, the spermidine content was greatly increased in barley plants. The production of spermidine saved the cell membranes of barley from peroxidation because it has an activity like antioxidants. By applying a foliar spray of JA, the oxidative stress was alleviated and other harmful impacts were also increased because, due to the application of JA, the root growth was stunted and leaf and chlorophyll synthesis was also decreased in some plants [ 58 , 97 , 98 ]. The lack of leaf growth and chlorophyll contents in the plants is due to the epinastic effect of the JA. However, a foliar spray of JA degrades the chlorophyll and microtubules in some crops [ 23 ]. JA plays a pivotal role in mitigating the drastic impacts of drought stress which is very lethal in severe conditions.

Various preslaughter handling practices and procedures of animals at the farm, during transport and marketing, and at the slaughterhouses may subject the animals to various stressors. The animal’s response to stress is very complex and multivariant and depends upon interactions of several factors such as type, intensity, and duration of stress, genetic makeup, previous exposure, perceptions of stressors, and intra-animal variations ( 5 ,  6 ). The activation of the sympathoadrenal (SPA) and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axes under preslaughter stress releases catecholamines (noradrenaline/norepinephrine) secretion, which leads to various physiological and behavioral responses to increased energy demand needed for “flight or fight responses” ( 7 ,  8 ).

Due to their above-mentioned harmful effects on the environment and humans, it is necessary to remove them from water; however, due to their high resistance to oxidation and light, it is difficult to remove them from aqueous streams [ 13 ]. Various analytical techniques used for the determination of dyes in water include liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) [ 14 ], gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) [ 15 ], high-performance liquid chromatography [ 16 ], and thin-layer chromatography [ 17 ]. As for dye analysis, UV-Vis spectrophotometry is among the most commonly used analytical techniques, as it is relatively robust, rapid, cheap, accurate, and precise compared to the other mentioned techniques [ 18 , 19 ].

CR7	In developed countries, TOF is usually diagnosed and treated at early ages by a surgery called Tetralogy of Fallot Total Correction (TFTC). In those settings, primary repair is the strategy of choice [ 4 ]. According to previous studies, the best time for TFTC is during the first year of life. For instance, Starr et al. recommended 6 months of age [ 5 ] and several other studies suggested the age of 3 to 11 months for the TFTC surgery [ 6 ,  7 ,  6 ,  8 ]. In contrast, in developing countries, the patients might remain undiagnosed until adulthood [ 9 ]. The main reasons for the late diagnosis of the disease are the late referral of patients due to the lack of complete knowledge (time of referral, whether the disease can be treated) about the disease. Furthermore, patients who do not have proper cardiac anatomy, suffer from severe cyanosis, have co-morbidities, undergo shunt implantation instead and complete surgery is delayed until they become older [ 4 ].	For instance, Starr et al. recommended 6 months of age [ 5 ] and several other studies suggested the age of 3 to 11 months for the TFTC surgery [ 6 ,  7 ,  6 ,  8 ].

T cells also signal other immune cells to engage in immunological responses. Numerous types of T cells cause cancer cells to die and stop them from spreading. CTLs are immune cells that have CD8+ surface expression on their surface. These CTLs participate in the apoptosis of specific cells by delivering digestive enzymes or cytotoxic cytokines in granules (TNF and IFN) ( 209 ). Cancer cells have been shown to resist the effects of CTLs by rearranging cellular function via the expression of coding RNAs and lncRNAs, resulting in a change in the cellular response to the native immune system. LncRNAs have also been shown to have a role in cancer resistance to CTL activity in recent studies ( 88 ,  210 ). NEAT1 is a nuclear paraspeckle-localized lncRNA found in a variety of cancers ( 211 ).  In vivo  studies revealed that inhibiting NEAT1 reduces CD8+ T-cell death and promotes active cytolytic function via the miR-155/Tim-3 pathway, resulting in increased immunological activity ( 212 ). Ji et al. published a paper in 2018 about the involvement of Lnc-Tim-3 in the regulation of Tim-3 protein expression in HCC. According to the researchers, an increase in Lnc-Tim-3 specifically binds to Tim-3 protein and blocks its interaction with Bat-3, suppressing downstream Lck/NFAT1/AP-1 signaling, resulting in nuclear localization of Bat-3 and increased p300-dependent p53 and RelA transcriptional activation of antiapoptotic genes such as MDM2 and Bcl2, allowing exhausted T cells to survive and proliferate ( 213 ). This research suggests that Lnc-TIM-3 lncRNA can be exploited as a target for T-cell exhaustion and proliferation. Increased expression of nuclear factor B (κB)-interacting NKILA lncRNA in cytotoxic T cells has also been linked to a poor prognosis in breast and lung cancer. However, knocking down NKILA inhibited tumor growth by boosting CTL-mediated activation-induced cell death, HDAC-mediated P300 nuclear localization, and calmodulin activation after calcium influx ( 214 ). The lincRNA MAF-4 is also involved in the development of the Thl response, which is mediated by the epigenetic silencing of the transcriptional factor MAF-4, which is mediated by the recruitment of chromatin modifiers such as polycomb group proteins (PRC1 and PRC2), which facilitates the deposition of H3K27me3 (transcriptional repression) by using the catalytic component partner, primarily EZH2. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 facilitates H3K4me3 (transcriptional activation) and H3K27me3 (gene regulatory regions) in a similar way (LSD1). As a result, lincRNA-MAF-4 interacts with the transcriptional repressors LSD1 and EZH2 to allow the H3K27me3 trimethylation mark at MAF’s promoter, effectively silencing its production ( 126 ). One way cancer cells impact immune suppression is by increasing the number of immunosuppressive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in the TIME ( 215 ). Tregs are one of the most potent and well-studied suppressive characteristics identified in the TIME. Treg cells may potentially play a key role in cancer’s immune evasion strategies, according to mounting data. Furthermore, new data suggest that tumor-derived lncRNA is essential for Treg maintenance and differentiation ( 216 ). For example, in HCC, lnc-EGFR plays a role in distinguishing Tregs and suppressing CTLs ( 217 ). Lnc-EGFR expression in Tregs was found to be strongly related to EGFR/Foxp3 expression and tumor development but inversely related to IFN-γ expression. Despite the fact that several studies have demonstrated that FOXp3 Tregs play a role in tumor growth, a recent study discovered that the two unique populations of Tregs, FOXp3 low and FOXp3 high, play different roles in tumor promotion ( 119 ). Another study discovered the involvement of FLICR lncRNA in controlling FOXp3 expression in Treg. The activation of the conserved noncoding sequence-2 (CNS-2) enhancer by suppressing FLICR has been linked to the enhancement of Foxp3-suppressive actions in Tregs via increased IL-2 production, followed by TCR signaling. Pei et al. (2018) established the interaction of SNHG1 lncRNA with miR-448 in the regulation of IDO expression in TILs to further understand the role lncRNA and miR interplay in IDO synthesis. The study found that miR-448 inhibits IDO expression, particularly in CD4+ TILs, but not in CD4+ cells in circulating peripheral blood ( 218 ). In contrast, SNHG1 sponges miR-448, resulting in an elevation of IDO expression in HCC cells. This implies that SNHG1 might be exploited as a possible therapeutic target for improving immunotherapy by decreasing lncRNA expression. Furthermore, it was shown that increased expression of SOX5 and SOX3 in the tongue and colon cancer inhibited T-cell function via upregulating IDO1 ( 219 ). A previous study also demonstrated that IDO1-mediated immunosuppression promotes tumor growth by increasing the number of Treg and MDSC regulatory cells.

This sample was designed at a scan speed of 400 mm/s and laser power of 110 watts, but the hatch spacing was the same for both samples. Both the samples have different manufacturing parameters; therefore, they have slightly different grain boundaries and grain structure. When we analyzed the maps in the vertical section, the formation of long columnar grain was evident along the build direction (BD) [ 26 ]. The re-growth structure is common in the melt pool process, where, in pure metals, supercooling is possible, which encourages nucleation in the melt ahead of the solidification front. The solidification further leads to grain growth. This solidification further leads to a mechanical property called anisotropy in metals. During the SLM, solidification occurs because of the deposited re-melted layer, which provides a substrate. For the formation of new grains, there is always a barrier because of nucleation energy, but there is no barrier for regrowth for preexisting grain, especially in pure metals. Solidification occurs continuously at preexisting grains present at the fusion boundary. The growth of grain is similar to conventional grain growth. The fastest growth is always in the direction parallel to the thermal gradient at the solidification front, which is normal to the rear melt-pool surface [ 27 ].

B6-molecules-27-01136	Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a phenomenon whereby microorganisms develop a variety of strategies to combat medications designed to kill them, resulting in microbes that are resistant to treatment protocols [ 6 ]. Globally, growing attention is being allocated by scientists to AMR since it has evolved into a widespread and serious problem affecting the entire healthcare system. In addition, the World Health Organization has pointed out that AMR is the most significant concern in 2019 and has classified it among the top 10 global public health threats to humanity. The overuse of antibiotics in human medicine, animal husbandry, hygiene, and the food industry can contribute to the rise of AMR [ 7 , 8 ]. Fatalities attributed to AMR are alarmingly increasing and it is being projected to claim 10 million annually by the year 2050. Significant global economic losses are also expected to reach a cumulative $100 trillion if more efficient and novel therapeutic alternatives are not developed soon to contain the rapidly-evolving causative microbial agents [ 9 ]. The list of microbes that are becoming resistant to all known antibiotics is expanding, under the currently limited and insufficient repertoire of new treatments, necessitating the development of novel classes of drugs to avoid serious public health problems.

28743020	Animal communication: when i'm calling you, will you answer too?	bib6	A new category of concrete has been given satisfying results in the construction and repair of engineering constructions; it is called engineered cementitious composites (ECC) or strain-hardening cementitious composites (SHCC) [ [1] ,  [2] ,  [3] ]. It has got, when compared to common concrete, a 300 to 500 times greater strain capacity [ 4 ]. Fracture widths of SHCC are less than 60 μm when subjected to high distortions. By giving this result, SHCC is the solving long awaited solution to reinforced concrete construction and this is because of its high tensile ductility and compact crack width [ 5 , 6 ]. Many researchers are conducting research on SHCC in different aspects, i.e., by varying the volume or type of fiber and trial situations. By using only less than 2 % fiber by volume, SHCC provides excessive tensile strength, allowing the SHCC for high performance [ [7] ,  [8] ,  [9] ,  [10] ]. For a material to be used in actual for constructions, series of consistent efforts are needed to satisfy construction industry [ 11 ], as practical application is far different from design process of SHCC because it involves finite element analysis. In addition to this, shortage of professional staff is also hampering the application of SHCC [ 12 , 13 ]. Once the researcher's attention can be diverted toward SHCC, optimized use SHCC can increase many folds in practical industrial use.

(12) N i = ⨍ max ( x i ) − ⨍ min ( x i ) (13) S A = N i ∑ n j = 1 N j where ⨍max (x i ) and ⨍min (x i ) represents maximum and minimum of the predicted output based on ith input domain, provided that others input parameters are kept constant at their mean values. It is quite evident from  Fig. 12  sensitivity analysis results that similar contribution of input factors was observed on the mechanical characteristics of SHCCs. The top three most contributing input variables are cement percentage, fine aggregate percentage and environmental temperature. The commutative contribution of the stated input variables was 60.97 %, 53.99 %, and 54.54 %% in the GEP developed models for compressive strength, first crack tensile strength and first crack flexural strength, respectively. The input parameters related to fiber properties (i.e., fiber amount, length to diameter ratio of fiber, fiber tensile strength and fiber elastic modulus) also considerably affected the outcome of the GEP model with commutative contribution equals to 27.98 %, 33.19, and 34.18 % for compressive strength, first crack tensile strength and first crack flexural strength, respectively. On the other hand, for all the three developed models, water to binder ratio, fly-ash percentage, and superplasticizer percentage are the least contributing factor.

10.1371/journal.pone.0090972	Protease inhibitors from marine actinobacteria as a potential source for antimalarial compound	B110-antibiotics-11-00182	The global drivers of AMR are complex, interdependent [ 95 , 96 , 97 , 98 , 99 ] from a One Health perspective, and inter-connected through international trade and travel [ 100 ], as well as migrant carriers; namely, refugee and asylum seekers [ 101 ]. The WHO reports that global expenditures on health may differ tremendously between high-income countries (HICs) and low-income countries (LICs), where health and subsequently AMR may not be a high national priority [ 102 , 103 , 104 , 105 ]. These differences may be related to the lack of awareness and education about AMR, poverty, hunger, poor sanitation, overcrowdedness, urbanization, loose regulations, and health inequity issues. Considering health as a priority is a political decision, and this applies to AMR. Multiple cultural, economic, and political dynamics may shape individual behavior and response to crisis [ 106 ]. The level of education may influence the individual’s accountability, but may not necessarily lead to a more rational antibiotic use [ 107 ]. Health systems governance and leadership, and the magnitude of the government’s engagement to secure social welfare, have major impacts on the systemic approach to mitigate AMR. The indiscriminate use of antibiotics for prophylactic, metaphylactic, and treatment objectives [ 106 ], and the increase in the global consumption of antimicrobials in food/animal production, have intensified the use of antibiotics to meet global demands [ 97 , 104 , 108 ]. The balance between doubling agriculture production and decreasing the uses of antimicrobial agents while securing food safety seems impossible. The global problems of hygiene, sanitation, water contamination, sewage, manure run-offs, and hazardous waste are additional challenges that influence the wide spread of AMR [ 95 , 96 ]. In some countries, slaughter and butcheries waste is released into the environment [ 109 , 110 , 111 ], untreated animal waste serves as fertilizer [ 102 ], and surface water is a shared resource between humans and animals [ 112 ]. Poorly managed hazardous waste may reach groundwater, drinking water, soils, food crops, and sediments [ 113 , 114 ]. The latter can have detrimental environmental effects which affect wildlife and generate antibiotic-resistant bacteria, causing widespread illnesses in the community [ 113 ]. Heavy metals and biocides have been associated with the co-selection and dissemination of resistance in environmental bacteria [ 115 ]. Heavy metals are found in the soil from agriculture and mining origins, and as trace elements of the antimicrobial growth promoters (AGPs) used in livestock production. Biocides are frequently encountered within the food and agriculture industry, intended for use as animal food preservatives, and within healthcare settings, as disinfectants and decontaminants. These are associated with the dissemination of AMR in environmental bacteria due to the decreased susceptibility of bacteria in the soil [ 116 ]. Biocides and antimicrobial agents can share common target sites [ 117 ] and can be located closely together in mobile units [ 118 ]. Many genes encoding resistance to these agents have been linked to antibiotic resistance genes in single genetic elements, leading to cross- and co-selection for antibiotic resistance [ 117 , 119 ].	In some countries, slaughter and butcheries waste is released into the environment [ 109 , 110 , 111 ], untreated animal waste serves as fertilizer [ 102 ], and surface water is a shared resource between humans and animals [ 112 ].	The study was planned to screen the marine actinobacterial extract for the protease inhibitor activity and its anti- Pf activity under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Out of 100 isolates, only 3 isolates exhibited moderate to high protease inhibitor activities on trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase K. Based on protease inhibitor activity 3 isolates were chosen for further studies. The potential isolate was characterized by polyphasic approach and identified as Streptomyces sp LK3 (JF710608). The lead compound was identified as peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3. The double-reciprocal plot displayed inhibition mode is non-competitive and it confirms the irreversible nature of protease inhibitor. The peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3 extract showed significant anti plasmodial activity (IC50: 25.78 µg/ml). In in vivo model, the highest level of parasitemia suppression (≈ 45%) was observed in 600 mg/kg of the peptide. These analyses revealed no significant changes were observed in the spleen and liver tissue during 8 dpi. The results confirmed up-regulation of TGF-β and down regulation of TNF-α in tissue and serum level in PbA infected peptide treated mice compared to PbA infection. The results obtained infer that the peptide possesses anti- Pf activity activity. It suggests that the extracts have novel metabolites and could be considered as a potential source for drug development.	10.3390/antibiotics11020182	8868473	Unrelated

Autophagy, triggered by energy or nutrient deprivation or as a quality-control mechanism, is crucial for cellular homeostasis and survival by providing cells with building blocks and energy for cellular reconstruction and maintenance. Moreover, autophagy regulates a variety of critical cellular processes including self-renewal, differentiation, senescence, and apoptosis [ 11 , 13 , 14 ]. In particular, autophagy is activated during differentiation to perform necessary cellular remodeling, including protein turnover, lysosomal degradation of organelles, and to ensure the quality of intracellular proteins and organelles [ 10 , 15 ]. Autophagy has been found to play a significant role in regulating cardiomyocyte differentiation by degrading and recycling damaged or unneeded components. Reducing oxidative stress and promoting energy homeostasis are two additional ways in which autophagy has been proven to positively affect the survival and function of differentiated cardiomyocytes.

CR32	Microvesicles, also known as ectosomes and prostasomes, range in size from 100 to 1000 nm and are released by direct germination (fission) of the plasma membrane [ 30 ]. Large structures called apoptotic bodies, up to 5000 nm, are released from the plasma membrane during apoptosis via direct budding. Exosomes are “nano biovesicles” (average size: 40–180 nm) released into surrounding body fluids upon fusion of multivesicular bodies and the plasma membrane. Specifically, they are derived from the internal budding of endosomes as they accumulate in intraluminal vesicles (ILVs), known as multivesicular bodies (MVBs). As the smallest EVs, exosomes possess unique characteristics over other nanocarriers, including immunomodulatory effects, biodegradability, longer circulatory half-life, and permeability across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [ 27 ,  31 ,  32 ]. Furthermore, The exosome membrane is enriched in transmembrane markers CD9, CD63, CD81, and TSG101, RAB family proteins, all involved in vesicle trafficking and signal transduction [ 30 ], and cholesterol, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylserine, and glycosphingolipids [ 33 ].

However, there is no statistically significant difference between carvacrol repellency percentage and CLI. Furthermore, in comparison to the positive control treatment (DEET 7%), CLI demonstrated equivalent repellency to DEET. Additionally, the repellency activity of carvacrol and CLI against  R. sanguineus  adult ticks was tested using a petri-dish selective area choice method, and the results demonstrated a significant repellency percentage, even after 24 h. CLI displayed significantly greater repellency activity than pure carvacrol. Tick infestation can be effectively controlled by preventing tick adhesion to hosts through the use of repellent compounds [ 34 , 67 , 68 ]. Carvacrol and thymol displayed long-lasting repellant effects up to 14 days after spraying as well as toxic effects on  Dermanyssus gallinae  [ 69 ]. Similarly, Krober et al. [ 70 ] discovered that carvacrol had significant spatial repellency against mosquitos. Konig et al. [ 71 ] observed that when concentration increased, the repellency of carvacrol and acetylcarvacrol increased against adult  R. sanguineus  ticks. The repellent effect of carvacrol did not significantly increase with concentration, whereas acetylcarvacrol’s response was obviously dose-dependent (the maximum repellency index was recorded at 56 μL/mL) [ 71 ]. Carvacrol and thymol combinations also displayed over 90% repellency activity against  Ixodes ricinus  [ 72 ]. At 1-6 h post-treatment, nano-encapsulated carvacrol showed significant high repellency action against  R. microplus  larvae with a low repellency concentration value for 50% of the population (RC50) (0.13–0.27mg/cm 2 ) [ 73 ]. Tick larvae can be disengaged from a host by unfavorable tactile stimulation, but a repellent can prevent tick larvae from adhering to a passing host [ 74 ].

10.1371/journal.pone.0090972	Protease inhibitors from marine actinobacteria as a potential source for antimalarial compound	B50-micromachines-13-01702	Several factors of dengue outbreaks and their epidemiology have been explored in literature [ 37 , 38 ]. There are many factors which enhance dengue spread; climatic and non-climatic factors are investigated for the prevention and control of dengue disease in populations that are more prone to dengue spread. The following steps are followed in the process: dengue hotspots are identified as well as the relationship between dengue fever incidences and its transmission that accelerates dengue fever spreads globally [ 39 ]. Other aspects of the dengue virus have been studied with several factors, including geographical, climatic, topographical, migration, demographic, and traveling [ 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 ]. An effective model is built for the prediction of dengue virus spread, and an AI-based analysis of factors which are strongly correlated with the rate of disease incidence is conducted.Factors that have a strong impact on dengue transmission have been reported in several studies, such as rainfall and temperature [ 45 , 46 , 47 ]. Many reasons have been given to support the rainfall and temperature factors. For example, mosquitoes survive in warmer temperatures, which provides favorable conditions for their growth, reproduction, and transmission rates. Moreover, rainfall provides favorable sites for their breeding, which has a direct impact on the rate of disease incidence [ 48 , 49 ]. However, in some studies, this correlation has been negated by providing the reason that, due to heavy rainfall, mosquito breeding sites are being removed [ 50 , 51 ]. Some studies have shown that after hot and dry weather, when there is heavy rainfall, dengue fever cases increase [ 52 , 53 , 54 ].	However, in some studies, this correlation has been negated by providing the reason that, due to heavy rainfall, mosquito breeding sites are being removed [ 50 , 51 ].	The study was planned to screen the marine actinobacterial extract for the protease inhibitor activity and its anti- Pf activity under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Out of 100 isolates, only 3 isolates exhibited moderate to high protease inhibitor activities on trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase K. Based on protease inhibitor activity 3 isolates were chosen for further studies. The potential isolate was characterized by polyphasic approach and identified as Streptomyces sp LK3 (JF710608). The lead compound was identified as peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3. The double-reciprocal plot displayed inhibition mode is non-competitive and it confirms the irreversible nature of protease inhibitor. The peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3 extract showed significant anti plasmodial activity (IC50: 25.78 µg/ml). In in vivo model, the highest level of parasitemia suppression (≈ 45%) was observed in 600 mg/kg of the peptide. These analyses revealed no significant changes were observed in the spleen and liver tissue during 8 dpi. The results confirmed up-regulation of TGF-β and down regulation of TNF-α in tissue and serum level in PbA infected peptide treated mice compared to PbA infection. The results obtained infer that the peptide possesses anti- Pf activity activity. It suggests that the extracts have novel metabolites and could be considered as a potential source for drug development.	10.3390/mi13101702	9609698	Unrelated

Exposing fish to stressful conditions those are associated with oxidative stress under intensive farming can trigger the higher ROS production resulting in extensive cell damage. The antioxidant defense system supports fish to retain endogenous ROS at quite minimal levels and to mitigate the oxidative damage provoked by ROS high reactivity [ 81 ]. Under normal physiological circumstances, the concentration of free radicals in fish is kept under a dynamic equilibrium due to their constant generation and clearness by its antioxidant system [ 82 ]. Conversely, increased ROS production can stimulate cell membranes’ lipids peroxidation and negatively impact fish performance and health [ 79 ]. Antioxidant enzymes such as GSH-Px, CAT, and SOD are considered main defense lines against the generation of toxic ROS leading to direct detoxification [ 83 , 84 ]. Fish antioxidant system can be coordinated by dietary enriched antioxidants that can scavenge free radicals. In this context, microalgae are enriched with natural antioxidants; however, searching on the mechanisms by which their impacts on the fish antioxidant system and whether their combination will add an additional benefit for strengthening this function is still scarce and needs more investigation. Herein, activation of antioxidant enzymatic mechanisms in groups fed higher levels of NSS microalgae blend was prominent, as detected by higher serum levels of CAT, SOD, and GSH-Px, and upregulation of their expression in fish muscle. The T-AOC is considered an index to mirror the antioxidant status of the body [ 85 ]. Notably, higher T-AOC and reduced fish fillet ROS and H 2 O 2  levels following supplementation of NSS microalgae mixture implies decreased free radical contents and lipid damage. Similarly, the activities of GSH-Px and SOD antioxidant enzymes’ in the plasma and liver of turbot were enhanced after dietary  Nannochloropsis  species supplementation [ 86 , 87 ]. The higher antioxidant capacity of NSS microalgal mixture in the present study may be attributed to their higher contents of DHA and EPA those possess excellent antioxidant properties [ 88 ]. Additionally, increasing dietary levels of omega-3 can reduce ROS production [ 80 ] via strengthening cellular ability against oxidative stress. Moreover,  S. platensis  is declared to have pigments those possess antioxidative properties and are capable of scavenging peroxide radicals [ 89 ]. On the other hand, higher free radicals result in MDA overproduction, which is one of the end products of lipid peroxidation inside the cells; therefore, the MDA level is generally identified as a marker of oxidative stress [ 90 ]. Herein, the contents of MDA in fish fillet were greatly reduced after inclusion of higher levels of NSS microalgae mixture. In accordance, dietary inclusion of algal  Schizochytrium  species augmented the antioxidant status of  Micropterus salmoides  and reduced MDA tissues levels [ 20 ]. Taken together, a great deal of researches has claimed the antioxidant functions of several microalgae owing to tocopherols, phenolic compounds, and carotenoids those account for free radical scavenging pursuits supplying a considerable amelioration to oxidative stress responses in different fish species [ 91 , 92 , 93 ].

B140-cells-11-01989	Over recent years, DC-derived EVs have been extensively explored as antigen delivery tools for anti-cancer treatments. Phase I and II trials that used EVs isolated from DCs of metastatic melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer patients for cancer therapy have proven that using immune cell-derived EVs in clinical applications is feasible and safe, although they failed to activate sufficient immune responses [ 134 , 135 ]. Various modification strategies were then exploited to enhance the immune-stimulatory properties of DC-derived EVs leading to stronger immune responses. For example, co-delivery of tumor peptides with α-galactosylceramide can induce an adaptive anti-tumor immunity in a mouse model of melanoma [ 136 ]. It was also demonstrated that EVs secreted by bone marrow DCs elicit improved anti-tumor activity upon Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) stimulation in DCs [ 137 ]. Additionally, in a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma, DC-EVs expressing tumor antigen α-fetoprotein and transfected by lentivirus could suppress tumor progression by increasing the percentage of CD8 +  T cells and reducing the number of Treg cells in the tumor microenvironment [ 138 ]. The therapeutic efficacy of DC-derived EVs is not limited to cancer therapy and it is suggested that low dose release of such EVs can potentially induce immune responses against HIV-1 infection [ 139 ]. Besides, systemic delivery of DC-derived EVs could mediate CD4 +  T cell activation and improve cardiac function post-myocardial infarction in mice [ 140 ].

Its production is generally considered to result in one of the most complex ecosystems, which is affected by both aboveground processes and conditions, and the belowground surrounding environment ( Korenblum et al., 2020 ). Light (intensity, wavelength, and photoperiod) is among the most important aboveground factors affecting root exudation, as it directly affects CO 2  fixation through photosynthesis, which determines the amount of material available for root secretion into the rhizosphere ( Vives-Peris et al., 2020 ). Ten percent to 50% of photosynthetically fixed carbon is translocated into the root and released into the spaces between cells and the root-associated soil ( Korenblum et al., 2020 ). Root exudation patterns are also correlated with functional traits of specific plants ( Herz et al., 2018 ). More leaf area or taller canopies are closely linked to plant relative growth rate including the amount of root produced, which thus could contribute to the secretion of larger amounts of root exudates ( Herz et al., 2018 ).

B99-nanomaterials-12-02278	Metal oxide nanoparticles exhibit a variety of electrical and photochemical properties due to their nanosize, high stability, and high surface area [ 28 ]. The primary functions of metal oxides in gas sensor devices include the ability to reinforce the conductive sensing interface, catalyze the expansion of nanoparticles with metals, electrically connect redox centers in proteins (biosensors) to the surface of the transducers, and increase the speed of detection and sensor responsiveness [ 98 ]. The rapid electron transfers between the transducer and analyte molecules are considered “electronic wires” and “electrocatalysts” given the nanoscale and structure of metal nanoparticles, [ 99 ]. The high affinity of metal oxides allows the working electrode surface to be developed using various methods, including physical adsorption, electrodeposition, chemical covalent bonding, and electropolymerization [ 100 ]. However, certain limitations of metal oxides have been reported, including a large bandgap caused by their function as semiconductors or even insulators, poor ion transport kinetics [ 101 ], and electrode film pulverization caused by the pronounced volume expansion and contraction during the charging or discharging process [ 102 ]. These constraints may be overcome through metal oxide hybridization with carbonaceous materials, such as graphene and CNTs, as well as with other metal nanoparticles and conductive polymers [ 25 ]. Apart from that, efforts to effectively increase the gas-sensing characteristics of metal oxides have concentrated on surface modification [ 103 ], doping [ 104 ], and morphological or nanosize modifications [ 105 ].

For biological processes, twenty-five different GO terminologies were identified, mostly associated with transcription and DNA-related processes ( Fig 2C ). Transcriptional regulation is a crucial process for a living organism. The cell can respond to intracellular and external signals such as environmental cues or nutritional insufficiency through this transcription-controlling process. According to the GO annotation, the molecular function category showed twenty-one GO terminologies; mostly indicated to several enzymatic functions, and the others related to protein binding ( Fig 2D ). Here, the DNA and protein interactions (sequence-specific and sequence non-specific binding) are involved in many biological processes including regulation of transcription, DNA repair, DNA modification, etc. [ 54 ]. Additionally, the proteins with enzymatic functions have potential biotechnological applications [ 55 ,  56 ].	Here, the DNA and protein interactions (sequence-specific and sequence non-specific binding) are involved in many biological processes including regulation of transcription, DNA repair, DNA modification, etc. [ 54 ].	The study was planned to screen the marine actinobacterial extract for the protease inhibitor activity and its anti- Pf activity under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Out of 100 isolates, only 3 isolates exhibited moderate to high protease inhibitor activities on trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase K. Based on protease inhibitor activity 3 isolates were chosen for further studies. The potential isolate was characterized by polyphasic approach and identified as Streptomyces sp LK3 (JF710608). The lead compound was identified as peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3. The double-reciprocal plot displayed inhibition mode is non-competitive and it confirms the irreversible nature of protease inhibitor. The peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3 extract showed significant anti plasmodial activity (IC50: 25.78 µg/ml). In in vivo model, the highest level of parasitemia suppression (≈ 45%) was observed in 600 mg/kg of the peptide. These analyses revealed no significant changes were observed in the spleen and liver tissue during 8 dpi. The results confirmed up-regulation of TGF-β and down regulation of TNF-α in tissue and serum level in PbA infected peptide treated mice compared to PbA infection. The results obtained infer that the peptide possesses anti- Pf activity activity. It suggests that the extracts have novel metabolites and could be considered as a potential source for drug development.	10.1371/journal.pone.0276085.r004	9560612	Unrelated

Additionally, this design illustrated a MoS2-based PENG device attached to a person’s body for the purpose of harvesting a variety of body motion energy, showcasing its strong potential for use in wearable technology [ 93 ]. For imperceptible sensing and energy harvesting systems, ferroelectric polymer transducers and organic diodes are shown in  Figure 7 b. They are integrated on ultrathin (1-m) substrates, giving them excellent flexibility. Simulations demonstrate that the use of an ultrathin substrate, which enables mounting on 3D-shaped objects and stacking in multiple layers, significantly improves the sensitivity of ultraflexible ferroelectric polymer transducers. In fact, ultraflexible ferroelectric polymer transducers form invisible wireless e-health patches for accurate pulse and blood pressure monitoring due to their improved sensitivity to strain and pressure, quick response and excellent mechanical stability [ 94 ].

A total of 44 outbreaks of FMD were reported that infected camels, goats, sheep, and cattle. A study was conducted to check the antibody status, and 2% of four livestock specie were positive for antibodies against nonstructural proteins, whereas for structural proteins it was 30.3%. In 2008, a significant decline in the antibody titer was found, indicating a decline in antibodies against FMDV ( 55 ). FMD is not an endemic disease; it is occasionally seen in the Eastern region and spreads to other parts of the country that are FMD-free ( 55 ,  56 ). Serotypes O and A are prevalent in Mongolia and the most affected specie is cattle followed by sheep and goats ( 55 ,  57 ). Disease evidence is also reported in Bactrian camels and wildlife ( 58 – 60 ). A rise in FMD cases was reported in 2017–2018, with multiple lineages of serotype O and a single lineage of serotype A ( 61 ). In this outbreak, virus isolation was done from field cases of Bactrian camels for the first time ( 62 ). A workshop was conducted for the eradication of FMD in the region. The workshop participants came up with a list of almost 80 potential ideas to enhance risk management after completing the risk calculation for all pathways. However, a remarkably high level of agreement was attained with the ranking by identifying the four most crucial recommendations in each part. The need to raise FMD awareness among herders, the general public, and veterinarians was seen to be of the utmost importance. Strengthening the system for regulating cattle movement was also regarded as essential, with proposals addressing various facets of border control and the issuance of health and origin certifications for internal movements. It was advised to stick with a risk-based immunization strategy for prevention in risk areas by concentrating on locations near the main transportation routes from the border to provincial centers ( 63 ).

CR5	As a result, the academic community and the business world are becoming more and more interested in the widely available natural sources of red pigments. Fungi are well known among non-traditional sources for producing an incredible variety of pigments that are frequently more stable and soluble than plant pigments. It is possible for filamentous fungi to produce a wide range of pigment colors, including yellow, orange, red, brown, chestnut, and bronze [ 5 ]. Recent studies have shown conclusively that fungi-derived pigments are preferable to synthetic and plant-derived pigments in terms of stability, availability due to lack of seasonal changes, cost-effectiveness, high yield through strain improvement, and easy extraction through downstream processing [ 6 ]. Additionally, some of these synthetic dyes are dangerous to use, can cause cancer, irritate the skin and eyes, and are not biodegradable; as a result, they accumulate on land and in rivers, posing ecological issues [ 7 ].

To date, August 2022, the CPPsite 2.0 database, a user-friendly updated database that supplies different information about CPPs, reveals around 1700 unique, experimentally validated CPPs, together with their secondary and tertiary structures ( https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/cppsite/ ). The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transactivating regulatory protein (TAT) was the first CPP that was raised in 1988 ( Green and Loewenstein, 1988 ). A few years later, researchers discovered other naturally CPPs, such as the Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 protein-derived VP22 ( Elliott and O'Hare, 1997 ), penetratin derived from the antennapedia, a  drosophila  homeoprotein ( Derossi et al., 1994 ), transportan derived from a neuropeptide,  etc . ( Pooga et al., 1998 ). A variety of synthetic CPPs was later developed based on the structure of these naturally CPPs, including poly-arginine ( Wender et al., 2000 ), poly-lysine ( Heitz et al., 2009 ), model amphipathic peptide (MAP) ( Oehlke et al., 1998 ), TP2 ( Marks et al., 2011 ), MPG,  etc . ( Morris et al., 1997 ). Furthermore,  in silico  CPP predictions revealed the thousands of these peptides that are waiting to be verified and used. Based on physiochemical properties, CPPs fall under the following three broad classifications: 1) cationic, 2) amphipathic, and 3) hydrophobic ( Lindgren et al., 2000 ). The positive charge of cationic CPPs has a strong affinity with the cytoplasmic membrane under normal physiological pH values. The negatively charged cell membrane glycoprotein combined with the cationic CPPs through electrostatic contact is subsequently internalized into the cell using a mechanism independent of the receptor. The first cationic CPP was Tat ( Heitz et al., 2009 ). Positively charged peptides involve natural protamines and polylysine are employed as a vehicle for intracellular delivery of proteins ( Haas et al., 2012 ) and NAs ( Cotten et al., 1990 ). Research results from oligo-arginine cell penetration capability have revealed that increasing the number of arginines improves uptake capacity. Indeed, polylysine has a much weaker absorption profile in comparison with polyarginine ( Tünnemann et al., 2008 ). Among the CPPs presently discovered, amphipathic CPPs, such as transportan ( Zhang et al., 2019a ) and MPG ( Mehrlatifan et al., 2016 ), are the most usual, accounting for upper than 40%. They are peptides with both polar and non-polar properties, and the non-polar regions are rich in hydrophobic residues. These peptides target the membranes through interaction with the hydrophilic-hydrophobic nature of the lipid bilayer, thus displaying the properties of lipids’ hydrophilic and hydrophobic nature ( Edwards et al., 2016 ). In contrast, there are just a few numbers of hydrophobic CPPs. These CPPs usually contain nonpolar/apolar residues or a functional group or hydrophobic motif that is essential for penetrating membranes. These peptides are generated by sequences of signal peptides containing residues of nonpolar peptides such as prenylates ( Vickers, 2017 ), pepducins ( Covic et al., 2002 ), and staples ( Lau et al., 2015 ). Hydrophobic CPPs have a moderately low general charge, and the hydrophobic residues are important for membrane element interaction ( Tian and Zhou, 2021 ). According to the findings, cumulative carrier hydrophobicity was a considerable determinant for improving the function of peptide in both internalization and activity of protein cargoes allowing for the finding of new and effective protein cargoes ( Hango et al., 2021 ).

10.1016/j.cub.2017.05.064	Animal communication: when i’m calling you, will you answer too	B281	Several species of  Aspergillus  and  Penicillium  produce patulin. In apples, the apple-rotting fungus  P. expansum  is the primary producer of patulin ( Şenyuva and Gilbert, 2008 ). Patulin was found mainly in apples and sometimes in fruits like pears, apricots, and peaches, and mainly in rotten fruit parts Turkish visibly moulded and dried figs ( Drusch and Ragab, 2003 ;  Cheraghali et al., 2005 ;  Karaca and Nas, 2006 ;  Şenyuva and Gilbert, 2008 ). Numerous surveys have been carried out globally to investigate the levels of patulin contamination present in apple and apple juice concentrates ( Cheraghali et al., 2005 ;  Murillo-Arbizu et al., 2009 ). While removing rotten or damaged fruit may reduce the amount of patulin in juices, it is not possible to completely eliminate this mycotoxin as it can spread to healthy parts of the fruit ( Gudmundsson et al., 2009 ). Eating food products that are infected with fungus, even if they appear visually clean, can increase the risk of exposure to patulin for consumers. This is because mycotoxin can accumulate not only in the visible lesion but also in other parts of the spoiled fruit ( García-Cela et al., 2012 ;  Sanzani et al., 2016 ). It is important to monitor patulin contamination levels in fruits and related products, including juices, purees, ciders, jams, marmalades, vinegar, and dried fruits, and to establish accepted levels for these mycotoxins ( Zhu, 2014 ; WANG et al., 2018). According to recorded literature, the concentration of patulin in apples that are infected with the toxin can range from 8.8 to 120.4 µg kg -1.  Ritieni tested six samples of apple puree and found that three of them had patulin concentrations ranging from 15.9 to 74.2 µg kg -1 . However, only one of the samples met the European Union’s standards for patulin levels, which stipulate that the mycotoxin should not exceed 25 µg kg -1  ( Camaj et al., 2018 ). Four out of eight apple puree samples contained 22-221µg kg -1  of patulin, according to Funes and Resnik ( Zhang et al., 2020b ). In addition, the fungi that produce patulin contaminate other fruit products, Pears are also a source of this mycotoxin and have been found to have high levels of patulin, exceeding the recommended limit set by the European Union ( Karlovsky et al., 2016a ). Because the loss of patulin during industrial processing is relatively tiny, apple juices are mainly associated with patulin contamination ( Zhang et al., 2020b ). In China, patulin was detected in 19 out of 30 baby food products analyzed, with the maximum concentration of the mycotoxin reaching 67.3 µg/kg ( Yuan et al., 2010 ). Other products from apples tested in Italy contained a significant amount of patulin. This emphasizes the importance of developing preventative actions and food surveillance programs to better protect children from toxin exposure. Patulin-producing fungi can contaminate various fruits other than apples, serving as another source of this mycotoxin. It is becoming more and more crucial to regularly check the levels of patulin present in colored fruits, such as hawthorns, red grapes, plums, sour cherries, as well as various types of berries like strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries ( Vaclavikova et al., 2015 ;  Vickers, 2017 ;  Iqbal et al., 2018 ;  Wu et al., 2019 ).

10.1016/j.cub.2017.05.064	Animal communication: when i’m calling you, will you answer too	B281	"Patulin in different food commodities has historically been determined using several chromatographic techniques, such as gas chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, and others, have been used to analyze patulin levels in different food commodities ( Kaur and Singh, 2020 ). These are sensitive and targeted methods. However, they require costly equipment and highly skilled operators ( Kaur and Singh, 2020 ). Biosensor technologies, as opposed to chemical methods, have recently been developed to provide some “cleaner” patulin detection techniques for apple juice. Selectivity, which allows for immediate detection of the analyte with little or no pretreatment, is an undeniable advantage of biosensors over traditional food analysis methods. They do not necessitate highly trained personnel and are simple to operate ( Ngolong Ngea et al., 2020 ). Biosensor technologies use a specific bio-recognition component and a transducer to process the signal. The affinity of the bio-recognition component to the patulin molecule will determine its efficacy. The sensitivity of biosensors will depend on their capacity to detect even the weakest modification signal, usually an electrochemical signal, following patulin bio-recognition. We have included some recent examples of biosensors below. The competitive immunoassay is an intriguing method for investigating patulin in food. An innovative strategy has been developed by combining immunological recognition of patulin with a surface plasmon resonance optical procedure to create polyclonal antibodies (SPR) ( Tittlemier et al., 2021 ). A laser beam initiated interactions between the test and targeted molecular particles on the biochip’s gold surface. This induction causes a shift in resonance conditions and, as a result, a subtle but noticeable change in reflectivity. This method was described as a cost-effective and efficient immunoassay for determining patulin. According to Vickers’ study on apple juice, the LODs in this test was found to be 1.54 µg/L. It should be noted that patulin was not detected prior to the sampling process ( Vickers, 2017 ). A new fluorescence polarization method using near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence sensors was also been developed that showed a great potential in fluorescence detection and measurement ( Víctor-Ortega et al., 2013 ;  Pennacchio et al., 2015 ). The increase of emissions of fluorescence polarization of a fluorescence-labelled patulin derivative, which binds to particular antibodies, is characterized. The LODs for the patulin ranges from 6 to 102 µg/L due to competition between the patulin and the fluorescence-labelled patulin derivative ( Melinte et al., 2022 ). The proposed technique was based on the unique properties of crystal or quartz materials. Oriented antibodies that were tethered were immobilised using photonics on the gold-plated surface of a quartz-equipped microbalance. This biosensor identified patulin at a concentration of 21.56 µg/L. An extra antibody was added in a “sandwich procedure” to enable detection of nano-sized analytes measured by a microbalance. Furthermore, the goal is to develop a simple luminescent sensor capable of detecting patulin. Further,  Zhang et al. (2017b)  have created a nano-sensor based on manganese-doped ZnS quantum dots that use phosphorescence to discriminate patulin selectively. With a LODs of 49.31 µg/L, this nano-sensor can detect patulin from a concentration range of 66.22 to 1.001 µg/L. It can also differentiate patulin from other mycotoxins. Much of the recent research has focused on the problem of restoring biosensor activity after it has been used. As a result,  Soldatkin et al. (2017)  tracked patulin inhibitory action, and researchers created a conduct metric urease-based biosensor. This biosensor is suited for assessing patulin concentrations beyond 50 µg/L in apple juices because it has a relatively high patulin sensitivity, strong selectivity, and great signal repeatability. The presence of heavy metals, on the other hand, causes some problems. Patulin and other heavy metals can create strong covalent interactions with enzyme sulfhydryl groups. An oligonucleotide aptamer is a monoantennary DNA (or RNA) sequence. Aptamers are typically selected using a well-known method. The acronym SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands) stands for “systematic evolution of ligands.” There are ssDNA aptamers present (by exponential enrichment). It generally has a high affinity for patulin and interesting properties like easy synthesis and labelling, no immunogenicity, low production costs, high stability, affinity, and outstanding specificity in target binding. This chosen aptamer was later used as a selective component in a patulin detection method based on a polymerase chain reaction. Enzymatic substrate system with chromogenic properties. The result was that the colourimetric aptasensor provided a linear response, which was very impressive. The detection range is 5 102 to 2.5 µg/L, and the detection range is 5 102 to 2.5 µg/L. The limit was 4.8 102 µg/L ( Wu et al., 2015 ). Lanthanide-doped rare earth-doped up-conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have gotten much attention as a technique to increase biosensor signal transmission ( Loo et al., 2019 ). NIR-to-visible up-conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) offer several advantages over traditional down-conversion luminescent devices. These include low auto-fluorescence background for improved signal-to-noise ratio, high photostability, low toxicity, high Stokes offsets, tunable fluorescence wavelength, and deep tissue infiltration. Biosensors linked to a transducing system that uses biological tools like enzymes, aptamers, and antibodies for recognition are employed to detect patulin in food. Aptamers are gaining popularity due to their remarkable ability to recognize patulin at low concentrations and modify their absorption properties, enabling detection at extremely low levels. They can be useful for on-line patulin control in the food industry. The main challenges of biosensors are the limited stability of the bio-recognition component (which affects the biosensors’ long-term storage stability), poor selectivity, especially in enzyme inhibition-based biosensors, and the high cost of antibodies when compared to synthetic recognition elements ( Kaur et al., 2015 ;  Burcu Aydın et al., 2020 ) (

24618707	Protease inhibitors from marine actinobacteria as a potential source for antimalarial compound	B42	Currently, in Korea, non-regular workers are defined as workers even if they are only non-permanent workers, part-time workers, or non-typical workers, and these can overlap with each other. In other words, even for the same part-time worker, there are part-time workers who are indefinitely contracted, and on the contrary, there are part-time workers who are fixed-term contract workers. Therefore, this study compared the effects of each on insomnia by classifying them, and found that the more the overlap, the higher the effect. With type 1, type 2, and type 3, we compared which of the provision of “continuity of employment contract,” “working hours,” and “labor provision method” had a greater impact on insomnia. In this study, non-permanent work showed the highest association with insomnia, followed by non-typical work. The association between part-time work and insomnia was not significant. The result showed that the continuity of employment contract had the highest effect on insomnia, while working hours did not have a significant effect. These results can be explained by those of the existing studies. In Japan, a study showed that non-permanent workers were much more likely to be bullied [ 42 ], and in the Finnish study, non-permanent work was a risk factor for depressive disorder and delayed return to work [ 43 ].

For exogenous and endogenous metabolites, scientists use non-targeted and targeted techniques [ 57 ]. Metabolites—including organic acids, peptides, secondary metabolites, steroids, hormones, ketones, vitamins, aldehydes, amino acids, and lipids—generate extensive data compared to transcriptomics and proteomics [ 58 ]. Advances in liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS), gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS), direct injection mass spectrometry (DIMS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with other metabolomic approaches have further clarified stress tolerance processes and metabolite profiling [ 59 ]. There are almost 250,000 metabolites in plants; the concentration and total number are considerably higher in stressed than non-stressed environments [ 60 ]. The detection of valid metabolomic markers will enhance stress tolerance in plants [ 59 , 61 ]. Numerous researchers have documented metabolic profiles under stress environments in plants [ 62 , 63 , 64 , 65 ]. For example, drought-stressed  Arabidopsis thaliana  accumulated various metabolites containing proline, gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA), raffinose oligosaccharides, and others in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Furthermore, activation of stress metabolic pathways and transcriptional regulation was dependent on abscisic acid (ABA) [ 66 ]. The superoxide dismutase gene was engineered into  Populus  plants, and data processing generated information on reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism [ 67 ]. Feng et al. (2013) reported a reduction in glycolysis-related sugar levels in salt-stressed barley leaves [ 68 ]. Shen et al. (2016) studied drought stress in chickpea varieties, which increased branched-chain amino acids and allantoin and decreased glucosamine, aspartic acid, and aromatic amino acids [ 8 ]. In  Arabidopsis , transcription factor genes,  Myb28  and  Myb29 , particularly for aliphatic GSL production and biosynthetic gene expression, unknown genes, and regulatory networks were estimated by integrating metabolic profiling and transcriptome data [ 69 ]. Furthermore, overexpression of these TFs in  Arabidopsis  produced industrial GSLs. Functional genomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics open a new direction for decoding secondary metabolism. We suggest that omics approaches from multiple platforms could provide molecular insight and enhance stress resistance through plant breeding.

Once this cutaneous barrier gets injured it results in diverse intricacies ranging from microbial infestation/infection to plasma loss [ 2 ]. Beneath it, cutaneous tissue harbors an interconnected blood-vascular network. The majority of blood vascular architecture is established during the prenatal stage of development, but adult tissues can trigger angiogenesis in response to injury, a process regulated by angiogenic factors [ 3 ]. Among different types of wounds The healing of burn injuries is a dynamic physiological progression and involves four interrelated phases which include hemostasis, inflammatory reaction, cellular multiplication, and epithelialization [ 4 ]. Thermal burns are considered life-threatening burn lesions that can cause the death of the burn victim if not treated properly. As per the latest survey, almost 1.8 × 10 5  deaths/year are attributed to thermal injuries [ [5] ,  [6] ,  [7] ]. Diverse interventions which include liniments, auto-grafts, allotransplants, and artificial prosthetics for burn wound management, have significantly improved therapeutic outcomes in patients with burn injuries [ 8 , 9 ]. However, healthcare costs associated with the treatment of burn wounds put an economic burden on patients [ 10 , 11 ]. Researchers have identified decreased vascularization, impaired keratinogenesis, diminished fibroblast migration, and enhanced levels of TNF-α responsible for impaired burn wound healing [ 12 ], but still pathogenesis of delayed wound healing remains yet to be understood. Recently some studies have found abnormal macrophage polarization and dysregulation of immune cum inflammatory response which causes delayed wound healing in burn wounds [ 13 , 14 ]. In the preceding decades, researchers have used a wide spectrum of nano-formulations and other traditional medicinal preparations for their therapeutic utility use in the healing of diverse categories of injuries [ 15 , 16 ]. A Plethora's of research findings have reported encouraging results of wound healing, amidst these preparations myriad cerium oxide and curcumin formulations have been reported to have biological effects favorable for the promotion of cellular regeneration in thermal injury microenvironment which includes anti-oxidant potential and amelioration of inflammatory pathways [ 17 ]. Furthermore, these studies have reported that these preparations have the potential to promote wound healing by causing enhanced expression of genes associated with the process of wound healing [ 18 ]. Results from a plethora of studies have indicated that in delayed burn wound healing, the involvement of oxidative stress and the presence of pro-inflammatory/inflammatory mediators play a crucial role [ 19 ]. Taking into account the increasing incidence of burn wounds, exploring novel medications with minimum side effects is needed for an hour. Considering the clue of wound healing potential of cerium oxide and curcumin-based formulation [ 8 , 16 ], the current study was formulated to evaluate regenerative capacity for tissue repair in burn wounds by using cerium oxide and curcumin loaded hydrogel in rabbit model and to explore and understand mechanistic pathways promoted by cerium oxide and curcumin loaded hydrogel in burn wound healing. These findings will further help in fabricating and designing effective topical preparations for various types of chronic non-healing wounds.

Preliminary research indicates that DNA levels surpassing the threshold provoke an immunogenic and inflammatory reaction, leading to graft rejection [ 29 ]. In addition to this Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) levels in the fabricated graft of the present study were found to be above the threshold level,  GAG  provides an essential micro-environmental condition conducive for cell-to-cell contact, migration of cells, and transformation of cells which helps in providing micro-environmental conditions that mimic actual subcellular conditions [ [12] ,  [13] ,  [14] ]. Similarly, another important characteristic of the fabricated bioactive material is porosity, and in the present study, we found that the porosity of bioactive gels was in the nanoscale which helps to serve as cargo for Nano-encapsulation of various types of materials like that of cerium oxide [ 30 ]. Furthermore, desirable porosity helps in the sustained release of nano-encapsulation and provides a sustained presence of therapeutically active ingredients at the wound site which helps in early wound healing [ 16 ]. In addition to these characteristics, the fabricated bioactive gel needs to be evaluated for swelling properties and enzymatic/non-enzymatic degradation characteristics. An ideal dressing material should possess stable enzymatic/non-enzymatic degradation characteristics and needs to have enhanced swelling characteristics to provide a sustained supply of bioactive ingredients and nutrients at the wound site [ [17] ,  [18] ,  [19] ,  [20] ,  [21] ].

B162	Nanocrystals are particulate structures that are entirely made up of drug particles through top-down or bottom-up approaches. Nanocrystals vary in size from 1 to 1000 nm ( Pireddu et al., 2016 ) and are kept dispersed and stabilized by stabilizers to prevent their aggregation. There are three kinds of stabilizers which are commonly used for nanocrystal development, including ionic stabilizers, non-ionic stabilizer; and polymeric stabilizers ( Müller et al., 2011 ). The topical formulations of drug nanocrystals can allow increased dermal bioavailability of the drug, saturation solubility, surface adhesion, drug release rate, and dissolution rate ( Shegokar, 2016 ). Milling approaches and high-pressure homogenization techniques (top-down) are the most common approaches used in nanosuspension and nanocrystal formulation. The final aim of nanotechnology is to increase the absorption of poorly water-soluble drugs in the skin.

Macrophage-derived EVs contain miR-223, which helps differentiate myeloid cells and plays a role in graft rejection ( 93 ,  94 ). Macrophage-derived EVs present enzymes for leukotriene biosynthesis, suggesting the ability to induce  in vitro  neutrophil chemotaxis ( 95 ,  96 ). The stimulation of macrophages with LPS causes secretion of EVs enriched in cytokines and miRNA, which promote inflammation through activation of NF-κB pathways in naive immune cells ( 97 ). Furthermore, EVs can be identified as M1 or M2-like depending on the type of macrophages that secrete the EVs ( 98 ), with EVs from M2 macrophages that help promote gastric cancer cell migration.

B52-cancers-15-02128	Baicalein inhibits the growth of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells by inducing mitochondrial apoptotic cell death. It does this by producing ROS, such as hydroxyl radicals, and reducing Cu (II) to Cu (I) in the Baicalein–Cu (II) system. These ROS lead to DNA and protein degradation [ 50 ]. In mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, Baicalein causes a significant increase in the expression of Bax and disruption in the expression of Bcl-2. This reduces mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria to the cytosol [ 51 , 52 ].

These pharmaceutical-activated compounds sustain harmful impacts on marine life as they are resistant to microbial degradation [ 112 , 113 ]. Due to the versatile chemical nature of medicines, removing these pollutants from wastewater is almost impossible.

Similar to the above situation, antibiotics have poor removal efficiency.

Before emerging petrochemical products, natural fibers were used in different structures, but when lightweight structures were demanded, the use of synthetic fibers increased. However, in the last decade, due to ecological effects, increasing CO 2  emissions, recycling problems, and the high cost of synthetic fibers, natural fibers are getting more attention. The limitations of synthetic fibers can be solved by adding fillers to the composite structure. These fillers or natural fibers decrease the cost of structures regarding the strength of the composite laminate. Yorseng et al. [ 23 ] generated a bio-based hybrid composite with sisal/kenaf and bio-epoxy resin. Many mechanical tests were carried out to evaluate the endurance of the hybrid composite under weathering acceleration conditions. According to ASTM standards, a series of tests, such as tensile, axial impact, thermography, and water absorption, were performed on this hybrid composite. Jute is another type of natural fiber, which was used by Jha et al. [ 23 , 24 ] as the chopped strand fiber with 30% reinforcement. They combined jute with glass fiber to elevate the inferior properties of jute fibers. The hybrid jute/glass fiber composite was used to make an exhaust manifold. Their hybrid composite has better properties in terms of mechanical strength and wear resistance. They made five different hybrid composites (jute/glass/epoxy) with different fiber weight fractions, and the tensile strength and wear tests were performed on different fiber configurations to find the best composite structure. Prabhu et al. [ 25 ] have conducted a study on the hybrid jute/tea leaf/epoxy composite laminate to evaluate the quasi-static and dynamic characteristics of the hybrid structure. They performed tensile, flexural, and impact tests on different types of laminates and found the best composite structure subjected to different loading conditions. Shireesha et al. [ 26 ] investigated the effect of hybridization of jute/banana fiber/epoxy under quasi-static loading and the toughness test. They performed mechanical testing on three different hybrid composite laminates and found the best mechanical properties of the structure. In a recent study, a combination of alkali/Luffa/epoxy was investigated experimentally, where the epoxy hardener was DDM-modified by hexagonal boron nitride nanoparticles. The composite laminate includes three plies made by the hand layup method, in which the samples were used for tensile, flexural, and axial compression tests [ 27 ]. Some researchers examined the use of aerogel as the matrix reinforced by fiber [ 28 , 29 , 30 ], as a hybrid composite that benefits the fabrication of strong material with high thermal insulation. Chakraborty et al. [ 28 ] characterized and synthesized fiber-reinforced silica aerogels using hexane, trimethylchlorosilane, and ammonium fluoride through fast ambient pressure drying. The product is recommended to be very effective for firefighting system applications in extreme heat exposure conditions. Rocha et al. [ 29 ] have researched the characterization of fiber-reinforced silica aerogel for Mars exploration, to simulate Mars’ environment on the material properties. They have highlighted that the thermal feature of the composite was not affected in harsh environmental conditions, which indicated the credibility of the aerogel matrix to withstand temperature variation. Lu et al. [ 30 ] have researched simulation of the tensile behavior of a fibrous composite based on the aerogel matrix using a new multi-scale approach that considers the aerogel material in nanoscale, while the bulk composite is simulated in microscale. They have shown that the mechanical property of the composite primarily depends on the microstructural constituents of the aerogel matrix. Moreover, they have highlighted that the characteristics of the fibers have a meaningful effect on the mechanical property outcomes of the aerogel matrix. The approach was recommended to study the mechanical behavior of other aerogel materials, considered in the form of a fiber-reinforced matrix. Arthanarieswaran et al. [ 31 ] studied the hybrid material properties of a glass epoxy composite combined with different natural fibers. In this study, banana leaf and sisal fibers were used as natural fibers. A different configuration of natural fibers with glass fiber and epoxy resin was used, and nine different types of test samples were generated. To evaluate the mechanical responses of different samples, they were tested under quasi-static and impact loading, and the dynamic responses of the structure were reported. To increase the impact resistance and other mechanical properties of FRP hybrid composites, some researchers have mixed different natural fibers with synthetic fiber. In these studies, mostly the jute, banana fiber, curaua fibers, and sisal were mixed with different weight ratios, and the epoxy resin with a different kind of hardener was used as the matrix. They could improve the impact resistance of the structures and reduce the material density by around 25%. These combinations help to decrease the loss of mass as a function of temperature and water absorption. Moreover, for the curing process of hybrid laminate [ 32 , 33 , 34 ], Chee et al. [ 35 ] prepared a hybrid composite with bamboo/kenaf natural fibers and resin epoxy to evaluate the thermo-mechanical loading with different strain rates. They studied the effect of oxidation resistance and thermal stability regarding elastic modules’ degradation when the structure is subjected to different thermal loading rates. Dunne et al. characterized mechanical responses of various natural fibers generated with the Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) matrix. They tested their hand layup specimen under different loading rates and evaluated the impact resistance of different hybrid composite panels [ 36 ]. Other researchers worked on the hybrid composite that was made by hemp/sisal/epoxy through the hand layup method. They analyzed static responses of the test samples with tensile, compression, and interlaminar shear strength. The other properties such as water absorption, hardness, and void density were also examined [ 37 , 38 , 39 ].	In these studies, mostly the jute, banana fiber, curaua fibers, and sisal were mixed with different weight ratios, and the epoxy resin with a different kind of hardener was used as the matrix.

While salt content affects the energy requirements for membrane processes, salt concentration has no impact on the energy needs for thermal desalination systems [ 7 ]. The substantially lower energy requirements of membrane technologies versus thermal ones are probably their most well-known benefit. While MSF uses between 10 and 16 (kWh/m 3 ) and MED uses between 5.5 and 9 (kWh/m 3 ), RO energy requirements remain at 3 to 4 (kWh/m 3 ) for seawater or decrease to 0.5 to 2.5 (kWh/m 3 ) for brackish water [ 6 ].

28743020	Animal communication: when i'm calling you, will you answer too?	bib7	To maintain a significant heat gradient that acts as a significant driving force for the movement of water vapor across membranes, a low thermal conductivity is essential. A membrane with high thermal conductivity can lose a significant amount of heat through conduction, exacerbating temperature polarization and plunging the thermal gradient. As a result, less water vapor permeates the membrane when the vapor pressure gradient is lower. The thickness of the materials, and membrane porosity can all have an impact on its heat conductivity. Compared to ceramic membranes, membranes which are made of polymers show a lower heat conductivity (0.1–0.5 Wm1 K1) [ 7 , 98 ]. Thinner membranes show extensive conductive heat loss, which is why they have greater thermal polarization [ 99 ]. Due to the lower thermal conductivity of the air inside the holes, high porosity reduces thermal conductivity while increasing membrane permeability [ 1 ]. Note that permeability also reduces with thickness, in addition to heat conductivity.

No DOI	Protease inhibitors from marine actinobacteria as a potential source for antimalarial compound	b0225	In addition, the odds of virological unsuppressed was significantly higher among adults living with HIV-TB co-infection when compared with adults living with HIV only. This finding is in line with studies conducted in Uganda and South Africa  [44] ,  [45] . Findings from Tanzania  [46]  and India  [14]  also supported the present  meta -analysis result. TB and HIV, potentiate one another, accelerating the deterioration of immunological functions. In high-burden settings like Ethiopia, HIV coinfection is the most important risk factor for developing active TB  [7] . TB infection also has a negative impact on the immune response to HIV, accelerating the progression from HIV infection to AIDS in turn leads to long lasting immune suppression and increase in viral load or treatment failure  [47] ,  [48] . TB often is an early HIV opportunistic infection, it may particularly favour early viral replication and dissemination, and therefore contribute to progression of HIV disease  [49] . Prevention of TB and early detection of virological failure and adoption of appropriate measures to ensure viral suppression and immune recovery are very important to reduce HIV related morbidity and mortality.	In addition, the odds of virological unsuppressed was significantly higher among adults living with HIVTB coinfection when compared with adults living with HIV only. This finding is in line with studies conducted in Uganda and South Africa  44 ,  45 .	The study was planned to screen the marine actinobacterial extract for the protease inhibitor activity and its anti- Pf activity under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Out of 100 isolates, only 3 isolates exhibited moderate to high protease inhibitor activities on trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase K. Based on protease inhibitor activity 3 isolates were chosen for further studies. The potential isolate was characterized by polyphasic approach and identified as Streptomyces sp LK3 (JF710608). The lead compound was identified as peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3. The double-reciprocal plot displayed inhibition mode is non-competitive and it confirms the irreversible nature of protease inhibitor. The peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3 extract showed significant anti plasmodial activity (IC50: 25.78 µg/ml). In in vivo model, the highest level of parasitemia suppression (≈ 45%) was observed in 600 mg/kg of the peptide. These analyses revealed no significant changes were observed in the spleen and liver tissue during 8 dpi. The results confirmed up-regulation of TGF-β and down regulation of TNF-α in tissue and serum level in PbA infected peptide treated mice compared to PbA infection. The results obtained infer that the peptide possesses anti- Pf activity activity. It suggests that the extracts have novel metabolites and could be considered as a potential source for drug development.	10.1016/j.jctube.2022.100310	8913348	Unrelated

B99-cancers-13-02765	In glioma stem cells PI3K/AKT signaling pathway upregulation leads to tumor formation [ 94 ]. NRF2 suppression reduces GBM proliferation or causes sensitization to chemotherapeutic treatment [ 95 ]. The Nrf2 knockdown decreases the proliferation of glioma cells via ATP depletion, 5′ AMP-stimulated PK activation and subsequently blocks the mTOR pathway [ 96 ]. The mTOR, a vital regulator of the PI3K event, is a vital hallmark in GBM, although pharmacological regimens to target the Nrf2/mTOR cascade are not yet found. Collectively, a thorough knowledge of the Nrf2 suggests that survival of tumor cells can be possible through escalating their antioxidant capacity, as well as molecular adaptation providing a higher capacity for inactivating drugs. Therefore, suppressing the Nrf2 pathway and overcoming the chemoresistance appears to have potential [ 97 ]. Another vital transcription factor is p53, that controls antioxidant gene expression. Indeed, p53 leads to both antioxidant and oxidant gene expression, thereby its role in regulating ROS is controversial. Moderately increased levels of ROS block p53, while elevated levels induce its expression. The p53 targets are sestrins that promote the peroxiredoxins activity, upregulating the cellular levels of antioxidants [ 98 , 99 ]. In particular, p53 and FOXO regulate genes that are not linked to Nrf2, although these factors promote HMOX1 expression, thereby storage and release of Fe(II), which plays an important part in tumorigenesis [ 100 ].	The p53 targets are sestrins that promote the peroxiredoxins activity, upregulating the cellular levels of antioxidants [ 98 , 99 ].

Some plants, such as garlic, inhibit the enzyme caspase 3 and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), which have a toxic effect on the testes, reducing testicular function and improving spermatogenesis by reducing these two enzymes ( Vickers, 2017 ).  Garcinia cola  polyphenolic sections showed prophylactic effects on the histology and hormones of the pituitary-testicular axis of male Wistar rats ( Omotola  et al ., 2017 ). Another study from Nigeria found that an injection of  Cissus populnea  root into male Wistar rats increased the secretion of male sex hormones such as testosterone and gonadotropins, thereby increasing the fertility of these rats ( Olaolu  et al ., 2018 ). Similarly,  Cocos nucifera  water improved reproductive indices in Wistar rats ( Kunle-Alabi  et al ., 2014 ). A study conducted in Iraq showed that  Cyperus esculentus  has a protective effect on testicular and sperm abnormalities caused by lead acetate in Wistar rats ( Al-Shaikh  et al ., 2013 ). The aqueous extract of  Cyperus esculentus , administered to Wistar rats for nine weeks, increased testicular and epididymal weight, increased sperm count and motility. These studies show that the medicinal properties of these plants are related to polyphenolic components, especially flavonoids, which can neutralize free radicals - the source of oxidative stress ( Methorst & Huyghe, 2014 ). Flavonoids in plant samples have antioxidant power and can optimize the function of the body's antioxidant system. Reactive oxygen species are produced in a chain of reactions that alter male reproductive cells quantitatively and qualitatively; antioxidants act by interrupting these chain reactions ( Methorst & Huyghe, 2014 ). In Iranian herbal medicine, many medicinal plants are used to treat various disorders and diseases. One of the most important reasons for the effectiveness of medicinal plants is the presence of effective medicinal substances ( Solati  et al ., 2021 ;  Bahmani  et al ., 2020 ;  Aidy  et al ., 2020 ;  Karimi  et al ., 2019 ;  Abbasi  et al ., 2016 ;  2020 ). The effect of medicinal plants on sperm production and testosterone is due to the presence of secondary medicinal compounds. According to researchers, methods for standardizing medicinal plants, quality control, information on safety and effectiveness are needed to properly understand the use of herbal medicines. Finally, we recommend more experimental and clinical studies using modern scientific principles and methods in this field.

This finding is similar to the study done in Southwest Nigeria, Egypt, and Ethiopia that stated a significant association between years of study and self-medication ( Osemene and Lamikanra 2012 ;  Karthik et al., 2014 ;  Helal and Abou-ElWafa 2017 ). However, a previous study conducted in Peru and Ethiopia did not show a significant association between the years of the study ( Núñez et al., 2016 ;  Gelayee, 2017 ). This may be associated with students’ awareness and knowledge about drugs and disease. In most Ethiopian TETC, students come from a rural area and live in town using a rent house. Through time and years of study, student’s awareness and knowledge about drugs and diseases might increase because of the Internet and social media access. The result showed that respondents aged 21–25 years were 2.47 times more likely to practice self-medication (AOR: 2.47, CI: 1.18–3.94,  p  < 0.05) than those aged 16–20 years.

10.1371/journal.pone.0090972	Protease inhibitors from marine actinobacteria as a potential source for antimalarial compound	B23	In the present study, participants whose permanent residence was in urban areas tended to practice self-medication more often (AOR: 2.97, CI: 1.06–3.64,  p  < 0.05) than those who live in rural areas. This finding was in line with the study conducted in Egypt ( Helal and Abou-ElWafa 2017 ). The possible explanation could be that those who lived in urban areas may have some awareness about the treatment and may have seen drug promotions, which may encourage them to practice self-medication rather than consulting the health professionals and visiting health institutions. Another reason for such a difference in practice related to residence might be related to the variance of accessibility to healthcare service. The logistic regression also showed that students whose parents had more than diploma certificate education level was 2.27 times more likely to practice self-medication (AOR: 2.27, CI: 1.32–3.71,  p  < 0.05) than those whose parents were unable to read and write. This finding is in agreement with a similar study conducted in Eretria ( Araia et al., 2019 ). The possible explanation could be that those who had a diploma may have some awareness about drugs and diseases, and as a result, may encourage their children to practice self-medication rather than seeking healthcare institutions.

CR18	Therefore, discovering a degradable material with properties similar to bones has become an attractive research area. Bio-absorbable implants can effectively prevent long-term complications, such as stress shielding effects, implant displacement, and foreign body reactions [ 12 ]. Besides, since the degradation space can be continuously replaced by cancellous bone, a complete intervertebral fusion can be achieved. As an orthopedic implant material, the density and elastic modulus of Magnesium (Mg) alloy (1.738 g/cm 3 , 43 GPa) are much closer to normal bone tissue (1.75 g/cm 3 , 18 GPa) than traditional metals (e.g., Ti: 4.47 g/cm 3 , 110 GPa), and the lower stiffness of the cages means less gradual dynamic loading and stress shielding of the fusion site [ 13 ]. Magnesium alloy also has relatively high strength and stiffness, bone conduction activity, and radiation permeability relative to titanium alloy, making it a potential cage material [ 14 ]. The current research on magnesium alloys used in biomedicine is mainly concentrated on magnesium alloys AZxx (containing aluminum and zinc) and AMxx (containing aluminum and manganese) [ 15 – 17 ]. The biosafety of aluminum content presented in AZxx and AMxx alloys is arguable as aluminum adversely affects osteoblasts and is reported to be neurotoxic [ 18 – 20 ]. Therefore, the aluminum-free magnesium alloy ZK60 was selected as the preferred material for this study. The magnesium alloy ZK60 contains zinc and zirconium as the main alloying elements that are biologically friendly to the human body. Relevant studies have shown that a cage with a pore structure can promote new bone growth [ 21 – 23 ]. It is challenging to manufacture complex porous structures by the traditional casting process, while 3D printing facilitates the manufacturing of porous fusion cages. At present, the mechanical research on magnesium alloy cages mainly focuses on screws and plates. There are still few studies on magnesium alloy cages, and it is unclear if they can effectively avoid the stress shielding effect and provide immediate stability.

This is specifically related to adaptation to CC, as even farmers with access to weather information and climate forecasts face considerable uncertainty [ 48 ]. Under these conditions, farmers’ perceptions of CC are important in understanding their adaptation decisions [ 49 ]. Adaptation entails not only an individual’s perception that something is varying or could vary, but also that they pay enough attention to this perception to be willing to act on it [ 50 ]. From this perspective e, the perception that the climate is changing can be seen as a prerequisite for adopting farming adaptation procedures [ 51 ]. The effective implementation of public policies aimed to promote adaptation measures also requires the support and contribution of the projected recipients. If they have a different view of the consequences or immediacy of CC than policymakers, implementation of the policy is likely to fail [ 52 ].

With the outbreak of coronavirus in 2019 in the world and its identification in municipal wastewater, the possibility of the presence of this virus in water sources and services is raised (García-Ávila et al.  2020 ). Coronaviruses are RNA-positive viruses and belong to the coronavirus family and the order Nidovirales. These viruses are widespread in human and mammalian species (Karami et al.  2021a ,  b ).

At the end of 2019, another disease, which has been become pandemic a novel mutation of the coronavirus (categorized as SARS-CoV-2), was recognized and rapidly spread in the world (Lahrich et al.  2021 ; Vosoughi et al.  2021 ). According to reports, the number of infected people with this new mutation, till June 2021, was more than 180.4 million individuals affected, among which more than 3.9 million people have passed away [ https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ ]. This disease has been associated with many huge disasters so that control of this infection has not been possible in the even with the best healthcare systems (Langone et al.  2021 ). The economic damage of trillions of dollars and the unclear future have created an urgent need for new solutions to such new infections (Zandian et al.  2021 ). Human viral pathogens transmitted by water can be associated with moderate to high health significance; these viral pathogens, based on the WHO, are adenovirus, astrovirus, hepatitis A and E, rotavirus, norovirus and other enteroviruses (La Rosa  2020 ). Studies have been confirmed that a number of family of coronavirus can be survived in water systems, and clarified that viral loads (depending to population infection rates) can be presented in untreated wastewater (Ahmed et al.  2020 ). As known COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, however, large amounts of SARS-CoV-2 RNA have been found in patients' feces (Wu et al.  2020 ), as well as in raw sewage (Fongaro et al.  2021 ; La Rosa et al.  2020 ), sewage sludge (Peccia et al.  2020 ) and surface water (Guerrero-Latorre et al.  2020 ; Prado et al.  2021 ). Detecting the viable SARS-CoV-2 in urine (Sun et al.  2020 ) and feces (de Oliveira et al.  2021 ; W. Wang et al.  2020a ,  b ) of patients has led to increasing the concerns about the possibility of transmission of COVID-19 by the fecal–oral or fecal–nasal routes. The existence of viable form of this virus in water and wastewater may be associated with issues for providing public health and difficulties in implementation of pandemic control strategies (Vickers  2017 ); this situation can be exacerbated in developing countries that do not have adequate access to sanitation and safe water. So far, credible evidence of transmission of COVID-19 through contaminated water has been achieved (La Rosa et al.  2020 ). Nonetheless, the need for research about the resistance of SARS-CoV-2 on environmental matrices, e.g., surface water and wastewater, has been emphasized by the World Health Organization (Organization  2020 ). One of the important sectors to protect the human health during such current pandemic is water services (Shutler et al.  2020b ). Finding the SARS-CoV-2 in fecal samples as in untreated wastewater can be indicative of the possibility of its fecal–oral transmission. This possibility has been resulted in worries toward the transmission of this coronavirus into the environment recently. These worries is rising when the untreated or inadequately treated wastewater is released to environment since it may rise the risk infection with SARS-CoV-2 in waters (Arslan  2020 ; Cahill and Morris  2020 ). The water which is used for human consumption should be treated by conventional methods and chlorine-based disinfection correctly should be used to provide a residual chlorine level higher than 0.5 mg/L in the distribution network; this can help to fight SARS-CoV-2 (Wang et al.  2020a ,  b ).	The existence of viable form of this virus in water and wastewater may be associated with issues for providing public health and difficulties in implementation of pandemic control strategies (Vickers  2017 ); this situation can be exacerbated in developing countries that do not have adequate access to sanitation and safe water.

B47	Plants with clinical applications play a major role in the control of plasma glucose through various mechanisms, one of which is the increase in the number of beta cells in the pancreas and the activation of their regeneration ability [ 10 ]. Induction of diabetes by STZ could severely damage the pancreatic beta cells and subsequently decrease serum insulin levels [ 44 ]. This fact was also confirmed by several studies that revealed that STZ directly causes substantial destruction of the pancreatic beta cells [ 45 ,  46 ]. So, treatment with MAE could increase the serum insulin level, and this could be explained by the presence of flavonoids, tannins, and steroids in the investigated extract. Therefore, the plant extract may have a high antioxidant ability that may support the protection of beta cells from harmful oxidative stress and other damaging factors [ 47 ]. Coskun et al. [ 48 ] reported that flavonoids could significantly decrease blood sugar levels and also exhibited protective effects on the beta cells from oxidative stress and preserve the integrity of beta cells of the pancreas.

Organic waste surfaces possess exchange sites that significantly influence the retention and limited availability of elements [ 44 ]. Vickers [ 45 ] also reported the retention of Cd on the surface of organic waste and demonstrated that this sorption is not an instantaneously reversible process. The high sorption capacity of Cd on organic waste surfaces may be attributed to factors such as electrostatic interactions between negatively charged organic matter surfaces and Cd cations, ionic exchange between Cd and the ionizable portions of organic waste surfaces and sorptive interactions [ 46 ]. Further, it is suggested that the metal speciation and bioavailability in soil are closely linked to soil pH, a key factor affecting the mobility of labile elements such as Zn, Ni and Cd [ 47 ]. Decreasing the soil pH increases the mobility of these elements. To alleviate metal pollution, organic wastes such as lime and manure are frequently applied, which can raise soil pH and decrease the metal toxicity [ 48 ].

B. D. Neurological Disorders Collaborator Group, 2017). It has been reported that 17% of women and 6% of men have migraine [ 128 ]. Nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound are some of its symptoms. Migraine headaches with moderate to severe intensity, start on one side of the head. They occur through hypothalamic disturbance that changes blood flow through intra- and extra-cranial blood vessels by a trigeminovascular reflex [ 129 , 130 ]. Different mental, environmental, and genetic factors are involved in the development of the disease [ 131 , 132 ]. In China, the prevalence rate of migraine was about 9.3% in 2012 [ 132 ]. This neurological disorder is associated with hormonal changes. After puberty, the incidence of migraine increases, whereas its prevalence decreases during pregnancy [ 133 , 134 ]. There is an increase in plasma levels of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a strong vasodilator and marker of trigeminal inflammation, in patients with migraine [ 135 ]. Different factors, like nutritional habits, hormonal diseases, digestive disorders, autoimmune disorders, structural imbalances, mental stress, and lifestyle are involved in the pathology of migraine [ 136 ]. Venlafaxine, beta-blockers, valproate, topiramate, amitriptyline, flunarizine, magnesium, gabapentin, and botulinum toxin type A are used to treat migraine [ 137 ]. The headache frequency and severity are prevented by supplements and medicinal herbs [ 138 , 139 ]. The effectiveness of traditional medicine and medicinal herbs has been demonstrated worldwide [ 140 ]. Pharmacotherapy, massage therapy, acupuncture therapy, and aromatherapy are used for the treatment of migraine. The best treatment for relieving the symptoms of the disease is aromatherapy. Traditional Chinese Medicine Aromatherapy is a monograph that indicates the efficacy of aromatic plants and their application in the treatment of different diseases [ 141 ]. Based on a single-blind study assessing the effectiveness of the topical usage of lavender oil on migraine, 47 patients with migraine at the beginning of attacks, were administrated with two to three drops of a placebo solution (liquid paraffin) or lavender oil rubbed onto their upper lip followed by inhalation the vapor for 15 min [ 142 ]. The procedure was employed for six consecutive migraine attacks. According to the results obtained from the 129 migraine attacks through the research period, the lavender group had a 3.6-point decrease in rating severity (on a 10-point rating scale), which was significantly more compared to the 1.6-point decrease in rating severity in the placebo group (obtained data from 68 attacks). The lavender group (71%) also showed a higher percentage of total or partial responders than the placebo group (47%). In addition, 74% of the subjects in the lavender group showed an improvement in migraine symptoms (vomiting, nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia) in comparison with only 58% in the placebo group. In animal models, lavender caused a reduction in inflammation and neuropathic pain by affecting peripheral and central opioid and cannabinoid 2 receptors [ 143 ]. In another animal research, after renal ischemia/reperfusion injury, lavender oil significantly improved antioxidant enzyme activity, decreased lipid peroxidation, and markedly reduced concentration of the cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-1β [ 144 ]. Also, the effect of lavender as a prophylactic therapy was investigetad for migraine in a randomized controlled clinical trial. In a three-month trial, the group that received lavender showed a decrease in the frequency and severity of migraine attacks. Additionally, lavender oil was found to be effective in preventing migraines [ 140 ]. Studies on human cell lines have indicated the efficacy of estrogenic and antiandrogenic properties of the lavender oil and it can be used in adults with an obvious allergy to lavender [ 145 ].	Different mental, environmental, and genetic factors are involved in the development of the disease  131 , 132 . In China, the prevalence rate of migraine was about 9.3 in 2012  132 .

B73-biomedicines-11-02329	Insulin is a highly effective anabolic factor that induces cellular growth and differentiation, while also facilitating the storage of substrates in the liver, muscle, and fat. This occurs through insulin’s stimulation of lipogenesis, glycogen and protein synthesis, and inhibition of lipolysis, glycogenolysis, and protein breakdown [ 70 , 71 , 72 ]. Insulin also supports glucose transport in muscle and fat cells by promoting the translocation of glucose transporter GLUT4 from intracellular sites to the cell surface. Of the insulin-dependent glucose disposal, roughly 75% occurs in skeletal muscle, while adipose tissue accounts for a relatively small fraction. Additionally, insulin activates mTOR, a member of the PI3K protein family that primarily functions as a serine kinase. The activation of this protein kinase involves PI3K activation, although another signal may also be necessary. The mammalian translation machinery can be regulated by mTOR through direct phosphorylation that activates p70 ribosomal S6 kinase and the initiation factor 4E for the eukaryotic translation inhibitor, PHAS1 or 4E-binding protein 1. As a result of p70’s activation of ribosome biosynthesis by phosphorylating the ribosomal S6 protein, mRNA translation is increased [ 73 ]. The release of insulin from the pancreas leads to glucose uptake in peripheral tissues, except the liver, and switches the body from catabolism to anabolism. Insulin inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver while stimulating glycogen accumulation through a coordinated increase in glucose transport and glycogen synthesis [ 74 ].

Biomarkers, including both enzymatic and molecular parameters, have been widely used in environmental pollution research and ecotoxicological studies. In this study, a significant decrease of SOD activity was observed after amantadine exposure, indicating the inhibiting effect of amantadine on SOD activity. The inhibition of antioxidant enzyme SOD could lead to oxidative damage of  L. japonica  because the excessive superoxide anions could not be quickly cleared. The CAT activity increased slightly more in the AT group than in the CG group on the first day, and showed no significant difference after 5 days of amantadine exposure. The activation of CAT on the first day of exposure might be due to the conversion of superoxide anions to H 2 O 2  and play a role in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in  L. japonica  under amantadine exposure ( Karthik et al., 2014 ). On days 3 and 5, the decreased CAT activity might be caused by immune fatigue.	The activation of CAT on the first day of exposure might be due to the conversion of superoxide anions to H 2 O 2  and play a role in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in  L. japonica  under amantadine exposure ( Karthik et al., 2014 ).	The study was planned to screen the marine actinobacterial extract for the protease inhibitor activity and its anti- Pf activity under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Out of 100 isolates, only 3 isolates exhibited moderate to high protease inhibitor activities on trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase K. Based on protease inhibitor activity 3 isolates were chosen for further studies. The potential isolate was characterized by polyphasic approach and identified as Streptomyces sp LK3 (JF710608). The lead compound was identified as peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3. The double-reciprocal plot displayed inhibition mode is non-competitive and it confirms the irreversible nature of protease inhibitor. The peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3 extract showed significant anti plasmodial activity (IC50: 25.78 µg/ml). In in vivo model, the highest level of parasitemia suppression (≈ 45%) was observed in 600 mg/kg of the peptide. These analyses revealed no significant changes were observed in the spleen and liver tissue during 8 dpi. The results confirmed up-regulation of TGF-β and down regulation of TNF-α in tissue and serum level in PbA infected peptide treated mice compared to PbA infection. The results obtained infer that the peptide possesses anti- Pf activity activity. It suggests that the extracts have novel metabolites and could be considered as a potential source for drug development.	10.3389/fphys.2024.1448259	11303324	Unrelated

B63	The present results of the study showed that women with the highest score of DQI had a higher intake of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and total fiber, in addition to a lower intake of total fat and saturated fatty acids. It has been reported that a high-quality diet is related to a decreased risk of mortality caused by cardiovascular diseases ( 60 ). Dietary combinations can have considerable efficacy on insulin sensitivity ( 61 ). The types of fat consumption have been investigated and discussed as a factor in cardiovascular ( 62 ), as part of nutritional planning, and for the increase of insulin sensitivity ( 63 ). The quality of dietary fats can affect the composition of cell membranes and their functions and also cause to alter in insulin signaling pathways in tissues ( 64 ). For example, saturated fatty acids can induce insulin resistance by reducing the release of adiponectin and disrupting insulin signaling pathways associated with glucose uptake in adipose tissue. In addition, fatty acids lead to insulin resistance by causing chronic and mild inflammation through inflammatory cytokines, lipids and their metabolites, and reactive oxygen species ( 65 – 67 ). The saturated fatty acid could cause activates serine kinase proteins, leading to inflammatory pathways, and through reduction tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1, adverse affect insulin transportation ( 57 ). In addition, other negative results of its consumption include formation of antagonists against insulin activity, such as sphingolipids ( 68 ), and the expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) ( 69 ). Intake of complex carbohydrates, such as fiber, and sources rich in polyphenols and antioxidants, including vegetables, fruits, and legumes, can contribute to an ameliorated cardiovascular status, due to their anti-inflammatory properties ( 70 – 72 ). Dietary fiber intake can, through its fermentation by intestinal bacteria and the production of short-chain fatty acids, lead to a reduction in the synthesis of cholesterol in the body ( 73 ,  74 ). The short-chain fatty acids lead to a decrease in the levels of C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 ( 75 ,  76 ). The benefits of polyphenols are related to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties ( 77 ) because they can reduce the release of NO and PGE2 by suppressing the expression of iNOS and PGE2, and also reduce the release of IL-1b and TNF-a, an effect that has been related to suppressing activation of the NF-kB pathway ( 78 ,  79 ). Consumption of these products leads to ameliorate regulation of fat and carbohydrate metabolism, improvement of hyperglycemia, a decrease of dyslipidemia, increased sensitivity to insulin, amendment of adipose tissue metabolism, and decrease in oxidative stress ( 80 ). One of the most well-known effects of polyphenols on carbohydrate metabolism is the suppression of the function of the key enzymes (including alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase) responsible for its digestion in the gastrointestinal tract ( 81 ,  82 ). Some types of polyphenols can interfere with the absorption of glucose from the small intestine by inhibiting sodium-dependent glucose transporters, such as SGLT1 ( 83 ,  84 ). Polyphenolic ingredients regulated at blood sugar level after meals and improved glucose intolerance by facilitating insulin response and reducing the secretion of hormones such as glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like polypeptide-1 (GLP-1) ( 85 ,  86 ). Some polyphenols can regulate the lipolysis mechanism through the induction of adipose tissue lipase, hormone sensitive lipase, enhances gene expression of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP-2) and carnitin palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1) ( 87 ,  88 ). Most polyphenolic compounds, because of their particular structure, have been known as antioxidant phytochemicals ( 89 ). They improve the oxidant-antioxidant equilibrium through the endogenous antioxidant system. These bioactive factors diminish lipid peroxidation and increase the total antioxidant capacity of plasma. In addition, they induce enzymes including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase ( 90 ).	The types of fat consumption have been investigated and discussed as a factor in cardiovascular ( 62 ), as part of nutritional planning, and for the increase of insulin sensitivity ( 63 ).

CR59	Concerns regarding the safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have arisen due to reported incidents of thromboembolic events, hypersensitivity reactions, and tachycardia post-vaccination [ 43 ,  59 ,  60 ]. Additionally, reports have highlighted BP elevation following COVID-19 vaccination. In a systematic review and meta-analysis by Angeli et al., encompassing six studies and 357,387 subjects, incidence rates of abnormal/increased BP and stage III hypertension/hypertensive urgencies and emergencies were found to be 3.20% and 0.6%, respectively [ 61 ]. Meylan et al. documented instances of stage III hypertension in nine patients shortly after mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, with eight having a history of hypertension; all recovered following monitoring and antihypertensive treatment [ 43 ]. These findings are supported by Zappa et al., who observed an average increase in systolic or diastolic BP by ≥ 10 mmHg at home during the first five days after the initial vaccine dose, particularly among individuals with a prior COVID-19 history [ 62 ]. Moreover, the vaccine recipients with pre-existing immunity exhibited a higher frequency and severity of systemic reactions compared to those without immunity [ 63 ]. This observed increase in BP post-vaccination suggests a potential association with elevated BP post-COVID-19 infection, possibly linked to RAAS overactivation.

CR212	Dendritic cells (DCs) are known as the most potent antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the body (Vickers  2017 ), which play an essential role in the acquisition, processing, transportation, and presentation of various antigens. DCs are also involved in activating antigen-specific T cell response, as well as the direct interaction between B cells and natural killer cells (Pende et al.  1999 ), so the presence of DCs is vital in directing the acquired immune system responses (Kingsley  1994 ). The proximity of these cells to MSCs leads to the induction of Th2 and Treg, and suppression of the pro-inflammatory T cells, which are the Th1 and Th17 (Spaggiari et al.  2009 ). MSCs can prevent differentiation of monocytes or CD34 +  cells into DCs and inhibit the functioning of the CD34 +  hematopoietic progenitor cell-derived DCs (Li et al.  2008 ), which leads to immature DC production and immune suppression (Nauta et al.  2006 ). MSCs also release IL-6 (Spaggiari et al.  2009 ), PGE2 (Zhang et al.  2014 ), and EVs, and further downregulate C–C motif chemokine ligand 7 (CCR7) and CD49dβ1 to prevent mature DC migration, which results in the lower expression of inflammatory factors and antigen-presenting potential in these cells (Consentius et al.  2015 ), thus less induction of T cells (Chiesa et al.  2011 ). MSCs can even shift DCs into an anti-inflammatory phenotype by downregulating pro-inflammatory factors such as TNF-α and IL-12 along with upregulating anti-inflammatory factors, such as IL-10 and PGE2, and as a result, these altered cells inhibit T cell activity through the secretion of IL-10 (Favaro et al.  2016 ).

B273	Virus-like particles are multiprotein structures that cannot replicate due to their lack of a viral genome [ 273 ,  274 ]. VLP vaccines consist of functional viral proteins responsible for cell-penetrating, hence imitating the organization and combination of the native virus [ 275 ]. These vaccines are produced using different expression host systems, including bacteria, mammalian cells, yeast, insect cells, and plant cells. One of the expression host systems for VLPs is bacteria (mainly  E. coli ), accounting for 30% of the VLP vaccine [ 276 ,  277 ]. VLPs are primarily designed to target B cells. Due to its adjuvant properties, both innate and adaptive immune responses will be induced. Using VLP vaccines, the humoral response is activated following the cellular immune response. Prophylactic VLP-based vaccines for hepatitis B commercially available worldwide include Engerix-B and Recombivax, which were approved by the FDA in 1989 and 1986, respectively. Furthermore, prophylactic VLP-based vaccines for human papillomavirus (HPV) which are commercially available worldwide are Gardasil and Cervarix which the FDA approved in 2006 and 2009, respectively [ 278 ]. According to the World Health Organization's report on 30 March 2023, there are seven COVID-19 VLP-based vaccines [ 244 ].

B379-foods-10-00981	Polymers have found some interesting applications in agriculture, such as controlled release of specific micronutrients or pesticides, as porous and water-holding matrices that avoid the critical soil drought. Moreover, some of these applications have been linked to the superabsorbent ability of the polymers employed. In the 1980s, several companies manufactured and commercialized composites materials based on plant biopolymers and polyethylene aiming at simultaneously providing biodegradability and fulfilling the requirements of the consumers. However, this strategy resulted in the release of polymer chains and microplastics to the medium, which caused environmental damage due to the toxic polyethylene residues [ 371 ]. In this way, microplastics disposed on land end up in rivers that flow into seas, eventually contaminating aquatic environments [ 372 ]. Therefore, the reduction of sea microplastics must go through the reduction of inputs onto the inland [ 373 ]. Microplastics are particles lower than 5 mm built from larger particles pieces. These particles cause damage to marine species, which eventually may affect the full food chain [ 374 ]. The removal of these small bodies is a real challenge; therefore, the best option is to avoid its generation [ 373 , 375 ]. Therefore, if the aim is to increase polymer biodegradability for agricultural applications, the path can go through the use of biopolymers whose degradation does not release undesirable macro- and micro-plastics [ 371 ]. To this end, superabsorbent biodegradable polymers have been proposed for their use in water-saving applications as well as for the controlled release of essential nutrients for plants [ 376 , 377 ]. These superabsorbent materials increase the overall porosity of clay-based soils, being recommended for their use in dry agricultural areas to reduce the drought stress during plant growth [ 378 ]. Moreover, plant nutrients may also be entrapped within superabsorbent matrices for their controlled release, hindering the water losses due to evaporation, and reducing the irrigation [ 379 ]. Although there are polysaccharide-based materials for these applications [ 380 , 381 , 382 ], Capezza et al. [ 370 ] recently reported the use of gluten co-product as raw material for the manufacture of protein-based superabsorbent materials with agricultural applications. These authors used a crosslinking agent (i.e., genipin) together with EDTAD to improve probe swelling, which in turn increased the water absorption capacity of these materials. Moreover, SAMs with agricultural applications have been generated from other proteins, such as soy [ 59 ], canola [ 363 ], zein [ 383 ], blood plasma [ 95 ], keratin and gelatin [ 384 ], milk proteins [ 385 , 386 ], and seaweed [ 347 , 387 ]. Moreover, bioplastics can also be used for the controlled release of both micronutrients and pesticides. This is the case of gluten-based bioplastics (releasing pesticides) [ 388 ], soy-based bioplastics (releasing zinc and mineral nutrients) [ 389 , 390 ], or even zein to prevent salt-leaching [ 391 ]. These results evidenced the potential of co- and by-products from the agri-food industry to produce materials that can be reused in agricultural applications with greater environmental performance. Accordingly, the life cycle of some crops may be enhanced since they can be used to obtain co- and by-products that in turn may lead to bioplastics that could be reused again in the first stages of their own life cycle (e.g., as water suppliers or for nutrient delivery to enhance crop growth).	Moreover, plant nutrients may also be entrapped within superabsorbent matrices for their controlled release, hindering the water losses due to evaporation, and reducing the irrigation [ 379 ].

24618707	Protease inhibitors from marine actinobacteria as a potential source for antimalarial compound	CR33	miRNAs are generally expressed at low levels, and this expression is different in various tissues and in certain environmental conditions. Considering their relatively small size, identifying miRNAs by their properties remains difficult, and experiments can be expensive, time consuming, and difficult. As a result, computational techniques have been proposed to effectively identify miRNA by their characteristics [ 24 ,  25 ]. Computational techniques take advantage of some features of miRNAs, including their conserved state among different species, the synthesis of stable stem-loop constructions from pre-miRNAs, and the minimum free energy of folding [ 26 ,  27 ]. Different computational approaches have been published in the previous decade. Computational resources containing expression profiles of miRNAs include human miRNA expression database (HMED) and mirEX 2.0 ([ 28 ,  29 ]. HMED and mirEX are considered to be comprehensive analysis programs for identifying datasets of miRNA expression. Moreover, some databases contain differentially expressed (DE) miRs obtained from many tissues; for instance, blood miRs are cell-specific miRNAs obtained from peripheral blood [ 30 ]. Likewise, ExCell miRDB is a specialized database containing curated information related to DEmiRs in biofluids [ 31 ]. Similarly, miRandola gives detailed information regarding several circulating extracellular miRNAs [ 32 ,  33 ]. In addition, many miRNAs have been identified as critical regulators of gene expression. Moreover, miRNA genes obtained from different species have been reported during the past decade, leading to the extensive expansion of miRBase, which is a core repository of miRNA sequences [ 34 ]. The current miRBase release version 21 contains a total of 2588 mature miRNAs and 1881 pre-miRNAs identified in the human genome (GRCh38). Moreover, miRNAs have also been identified in viruses. In a study by Tushcl et al., the miRNAs encoded by Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) were identified. Following this discovery, different viral miRNAs have been reported in other viruses [ 35 ,  36 ]. Currently, VIRmiRNA is a comprehensive database for experimentally verified viral miRNAs, containing 1308 different viral miRNA sequences [ 37 ]. A number of computational resources are focused on specific types of diseases; such as OncomiRDB, miRCancer, and dbDEMC, which are catalogs of deregulated miRNAs in different types of cancer [ 38 ,  39 ]. PhenomiR is an online database listing dysregulated miRNAs in different diseases and biological pathways [ 40 ]. Moreover, AVIRmiR is a subdatabase of VIRmiRNA [ 37 ], containing antiviral miRNAs that have been found to be involved in viral infections.

The study was planned to screen the marine actinobacterial extract for the protease inhibitor activity and its anti- Pf activity under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Out of 100 isolates, only 3 isolates exhibited moderate to high protease inhibitor activities on trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase K. Based on protease inhibitor activity 3 isolates were chosen for further studies. The potential isolate was characterized by polyphasic approach and identified as Streptomyces sp LK3 (JF710608). The lead compound was identified as peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3. The double-reciprocal plot displayed inhibition mode is non-competitive and it confirms the irreversible nature of protease inhibitor. The peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3 extract showed significant anti plasmodial activity (IC50: 25.78 µg/ml). In in vivo model, the highest level of parasitemia suppression (≈ 45%) was observed in 600 mg/kg of the peptide. These analyses revealed no significant changes were observed in the spleen and liver tissue during 8 dpi. The results confirmed up-regulation of TGF-β and down regulation of TNF-α in tissue and serum level in PbA infected peptide treated mice compared to PbA infection. The results obtained infer that the peptide possesses anti- Pf activity activity. It suggests that the extracts have novel metabolites and could be considered as a potential source for drug development.	10.1186/s11658-022-00317-9	8853298	Unrelated

Herpes zoster ( Hashemipour et al., 2014 ), rubella ( Zeina et al., 1996 ) influenza ( Watanabe et al., 2014 ), herpes disease ( Semprini et al., 2017 ), respiratory syncytial virus ( Zareie, 2011 ), AIDS ( Behbahani, 2014 ), immunodeficiency virus ( Al-Waili et al., 2006 ), viral hepatitis ( Abdulrhman et al., 2016 ), gingivostomatitis ( Awad and Hamad, 2018 ), rabies rhinoconjunctivitis ( Igado et al., 2010 ), and COVID-19 are among the diseases that honey and its main components can combat ( Filipe, 2020 ). Honey’s antiviral activities and their primary components have a large and unknown method of action. Honey’s antiviral activity is frequently linked to anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-resistance, and anti-apoptotic activities through altering cellular signaling pathways such as MAPK, NF-kB, Nrf2, and others ( Docherty et al., 2004 ;  Shakibaei et al., 2011a ;  Shakibaei et al., 2011b ;  Vickers, 2017 ;  Buhrmann et al., 2019 ;  Buhrmann et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, these agents have a direct effect on the structure of the virus, such as when honey and its primary components interact with structural and non-structural proteins in the virus, or when they connect to virus target receptors ( Yaghoobi and Kazerouni, 2013 ).

CR64	Moreover, studies have shown that succinate induces cellular migration by activating the SUCNR1 receptor. This receptor also referred to as GPR91, is a member of the P2Y purinoreceptor family, which consists of G protein-coupled receptors [ 14 ]. Various tissues, such as blood cells, adipose tissue, the liver, retina, and kidney, exhibit the expression of this receptor. Recently, it has been discovered that this receptor, along with its ligand succinate, plays a crucial role in these tissues as a new regulator of local stress conditions like ischemia, hypoxia, toxicity, and hyperglycemia. Through the activation of PKC phosphorylation and subsequent activation of p38 MAPK, SUCNR1 induces cell migration as demonstrated in (Fig.  5 ) [ 39 ]. Furthermore, succinate triggers the formation of new blood vessels by activating extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) through the specific succinate receptor GPR91. This finding indicates that this process takes place independently of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) [ 8 ,  39 ]. A growing body of studies links the ERK1/2 signaling pathway to angiogenesis [ 45 ,  64 ,  75 ]. Furthermore, as stated by Loriot, Burnichon et al. [ 27 ], the accumulation of succinate leads to an excessive methylation process, which is capable of initiating the Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Furthermore, Wang et al. conducted a study revealing that the depletion of SDHB results in the activation of the TGFß signaling pathway within colorectal cancer cells. This activation occurs through the enhancement of the tight-junction transcriptional repression complex SNAIL1-SMAD3/SMAD4, ultimately leading to EMT, as well as promoting cell migration and invasion [ 34 ].

B38-materials-17-02634	The phase transition behavior of NiTi-based SMA is significantly affected by the chemical composition and microstructure of the alloy. The phase transition path of solid solution binary NiTi alloy is B2 (parent phase, cubic crystal structure) → B19′ (martensitic phase, monoclinic crystal structure). The change in microstructure [ 35 , 36 ] (grain size, precipitated phase, dislocation, etc.) can cause the R phase to appear in the phase transition path of NiTi SMA. The R phase is the pre-phase transition product of the alloy before the martensitic transition and the R phase transition is the same as the martensitic phase transition. In the process of deformation, the surface of the phase can undergo a convex elastic change, but the deformation variable is much smaller than that of the martensitic phase transition, accounting for only about 1/10 [ 37 ]. Doping of many elements also changed the phase transition path of NiTi alloy; for example, the doping of the Fe element caused the appearance of the R phase [ 38 ], and the doping of the Cu element caused the appearance of the B19 phase (martensite phase, rhomboidal structure) [ 39 ]. Nb, Fe, Co, Cr, V, Mn, A1 [ 40 , 41 ], and other elements reduced the martensitic phase transition point of NiTi alloy, while Pt, Pd, Hf, Ta, Zr, Au, Cu [ 42 , 43 , 44 ], and other elements increased it.

This goal can be met by using diamond as a high-performance substrate for the culture of non-differentiated cells, such as neural stem cells (NSCs) [ 5 , 6 ], human-induced pluripotent stem cells (IPS) and IPS-derived neuronal progenitors [ 7 ], various types of neurons [ 8 , 9 , 10 ], cells from the connective tissue such as fibroblasts [ 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 ] and osteoblasts [ 15 , 16 , 17 ], epithelial cells [ 18 ], among others [ 1 ]; and by using it to create biointerfaces [ 19 ].

No DOI	Protease inhibitors from marine actinobacteria as a potential source for antimalarial compound	bib18	COVID-19 has given rise to fear among the public and is more so to the HCPs handling the patients directly. A global survey among healthcare workers and the public showed a great sense of loss of control of becoming infected and dying, more so infecting their loved ones with COVID-19 [ 16 ], although fear can also be attributed to decreased physical and environmental well-being [ 17 ,  18 ]. COVID-19 has posed a serious occupational health risk to HCPs due to their frequent exposure to infected individuals [ 19 ,  20 ]. Fear among HCPs in countries where COVID-19 is on a steady rise can be among the many factors contributing to their worries. In the recent statistics from the WHO, as of to date June 2021, 174,061,995 million people around the globe was infected by the virus, countries such as India, Indonesia, and the Philippines were among the highest in Asia [ 21 ]. Based on the study results, the Filipino respondents recorded the highest fear of getting infected. However, fear among healthcare workers was seen as universal among other countries [ 22 ,  23 ], fear can also gravely affect their performance at work and the way they deal with the patient, which can lead further to burnout and anxiety that is detrimental as to how they perform their duties [ 24 ,  25 ]. The case of Filipino healthcare worker is unique considering that vast majority of its healthcare workforce are scattered in the diaspora. Undeterred by the pandemic, many Filipinos continue to emigrate to join the healthcare industry abroad [ 26 ]. The sense of fear is magnified by several contributing factors such that of being miles away from their families, working in a foreign environment, lack support, the rising death tolls of frontline healthcare workers at home and overseas and the obligation to follow their employers as immigrants on visas [ 27 ]. Curiously, other frontline HCPs caring for COVID-19 patients are described to have less fear about becoming infected than HCPs in other units, like the study conducted about the fears related to SARS that have similar results [ 28 ]. The study findings also suggest that age, gender, type of occupation is significant in the level of fears felt by the healthcare workers. This study identified older and female healthcare workers tend to be more fearful of being infected and like those recently published [ 29 ]. Physicians possessed the highest level of fear on being infected. Fear stems not only from personal reasons or loss of health integrity but also brought by the rising concerns of how HCP are perceived publicly; there are growing accounts of HCPs being spurned and hounded by a fearful public because of their occupation [ 30 ]. A global study among HCPs revealed they significantly experienced more COVID-19-related bullying after identifying the confounding effects of job-related, personal, geographic, and sociocultural variables [ 31 ]. However, not all stories about HCPs are negative, several stories are positive, encouraging and talks about their bravery; HCPs honors us all with their commitment, dedication, and professionalism [ 32 ].	A global survey among healthcare workers and the public showed a great sense of loss of control of becoming infected and dying, more so infecting their loved ones with COVID-19 [ 16 ], although fear can also be attributed to decreased physical and environmental well-being [ 17 ,  18 ].	The study was planned to screen the marine actinobacterial extract for the protease inhibitor activity and its anti- Pf activity under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Out of 100 isolates, only 3 isolates exhibited moderate to high protease inhibitor activities on trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase K. Based on protease inhibitor activity 3 isolates were chosen for further studies. The potential isolate was characterized by polyphasic approach and identified as Streptomyces sp LK3 (JF710608). The lead compound was identified as peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3. The double-reciprocal plot displayed inhibition mode is non-competitive and it confirms the irreversible nature of protease inhibitor. The peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3 extract showed significant anti plasmodial activity (IC50: 25.78 µg/ml). In in vivo model, the highest level of parasitemia suppression (≈ 45%) was observed in 600 mg/kg of the peptide.

The finding of our study is also in agreement with studies done in Ethiopia 30 – 32  which indicates larger family size (≥ 4 or 5) was determining factor for wasting among under-five children. The possible explanation is that short birth interval is positively correlated with malnutrition among under five children, which means children with short birth interval has higher risk of malnutrition 10 , 46 , 47 . It may also due to households either with higher number of under- five children or larger family size increase chore on mothers, which compromise the care or feeding practices of their children 31 .

CR60	The SSBs could affect mental health by their sugary components; indeed, sugar can induce chronic systematic inflammation by activating the innate immune system, thus affecting psychological disorders [ 59 ]. Animal studies have shown that sugar could increase depression incidence by activating the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and inducing elevation in glucocorticoids [ 60 ]. The mechanism behind the effect of coffee on the mental health is the potential stimulation of the central nervous system, enhancing dopaminergic neurotransmission [ 61 ]. One mechanism by which beverages could affect psychological disorders via carbohydrates. By modulating plasma concentrations of tryptophan and of large neutral amino acids (LNAA), carbohydrates could affect mental performance [ 62 ]. The ability of carbohydrates to increase the uptake of circulating tryptophan into the brain depends on its ability to promote the secretion of insulin [ 63 ]; thus, by consuming more carbohydrates, a greater secretion of insulin will ensue, plasma levels of LNAA will decrease, and the supply of tryptophan to the brain will increase [ 63 ]. Moreover, by consuming SSBs, and the side effects that follow, including obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), researchers have found a bi-directional relationship between obesity or T2D and depression [ 64 – 66 ].	Animal studies have shown that sugar could increase depression incidence by activating the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and inducing elevation in glucocorticoids [ 60 ].

Studies have reported significant changes in the thickness of the maxillary alveolar bone following alterations in the inclination of the maxillary incisors [ 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 ]. In the present study, comparison of the left side to the right side showed no statistically significant difference except in one point (Point A) in the central incisor region. The studies of Othman et al. [ 14 ], Sherrah et al. [ 15 ], and Alsaffar et al. [ 16 ] were in accordance with the present study. However, in contrast, one study reported differences in some points, only on the left side, to be significantly different in some measurements of buccal bone thickness according to age and gender [ 30 ]. Farahamnd et al. [ 31 ] concluded that there were some recognizable differences in the facial bone thickness between the left and the right side. Another study reported no significant difference between right and left in central and lateral incisors; however, the canine showed a significant difference [ 32 ]. Hassan et al. found differences only in the apical level between the right and left sides in both females and males [ 33 ]. Thus, although there are a few regional studies in accord with the results of our study, other studies’ outcomes were contradictory to our findings. The reason for the variation may be ethnic and racial differences, the methods used, or technical aspects of CBCT.

Typical alveolar crest to CEJ distance is reported to be 2 mm apical to the CEJ [ 40 ]. The Zhou et al. [ 41 ] findings regarding the alveolar crest height were very close to our study (1.80 ± 0.56 mm). Januário et al. [ 38 ] reported about 1.6 and 3 mm, which are also close to the findings of our study. However, other studies have reported a high variation in CEJ–bone crest (0.8 to 7.2 mm) [ 28 ]. Studies done in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have reported slightly higher ranges of 2.66 ± 0.88 to 3.06 ± 1.09 mm [ 12 ], 2.84 ± 2.01 to 5.68 ± 4.91 [ 16 ], and 2.09 ± 0.66 to 2.74 ± 0.81 [ 15 ]. If the distance between the CEJ to the alveolar crest is more than 3 mm, there may be more chance of the occurrence of dehiscence in the implant site. The differences seen in the distance from CEJ to the crest of the alveolar bone may be due to ethnic and racial variations. Technically, the types of CBCT machines, digital calipers, and software used may also have had an impact on this measurement.

B18-ijms-23-12528	Nuclear receptors contain two common structural elements—a DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a ligand-binding domain (LBD)—which are involved in the regulation of myriad biological processes [ 10 ]. In the holometabolous insect  D. melanogaster , some genes, such as nuclear receptor E75 ( E75 ), nuclear receptor E78 ( E78 ), hormone receptor 3 ( HR3 ), hormone receptor 4 ( HR4 ), ecdysis-triggering hormone receptor ( ETHR ) and Fushi tarazu factor-1 ( Ftz-f1 ), are transcriptionally regulated by 20E and play a central role in transducing the molting signals [ 11 , 12 ]. The expressions of  HR3  and  E75B  increased with the increase in the 20E titer during  D. melanogaster  pupation, and  βFtz-f1  was activated after the decrease in 20E [ 13 ]. In the hemimetabolous insect  Blattella germanica , the regulatory relationship between nuclear receptor genes  E75 ,  HR3 ,  HR4  and  Ftz-f1  changed with the fluctuation in the 20E titer [ 14 ]. In insects, the function of nuclear receptors activated by 20E has been reported in detail. For example, an  E75A  mutation causes developmental arrest and molting defects in  Drosophila  and the  E75C -mutant  Drosophila  die in adulthood, whereas  E75B -mutant individuals survive and reproduce normally [ 15 ]. The knockdown of  BgE75  results in  B. germanica  prothoracic gland degeneration and ecdysteroid deficiency [ 14 ].  HR3  is involved in the regulation of chitin synthesis and degradation during  Locusta migratoria  molting [ 16 ]. Silencing of  BgFtz-f1  prevents normal molting and development of  B. germanica  [ 17 ], and  Ftz-f1  is involved in the regulation of  Leptinotarsa decemlineata ’s pupation by regulating 20E and JH titers [ 18 ].  HR4  plays an important role in  Tribolium castaneum  molting and ovulation [ 19 ] and plays a central role in coordinating growth and the maturation of  D. melanogaster  [ 20 ]. In addition, the  HR4  gene has been identified in some crustacean transcriptomes. In  Litopenaeus vannamei  and  Daphnia ,  HR4  was identified as an ecdysone signaling response gene [ 21 , 22 ]. In  Callinectes sapidus , increased ecdysteroid concentration induced  HR4  expression [ 23 ]. Altogether, nuclear receptor genes have been extensively studied in insect molting and development, but reports on crustaceans are still lacking.	Silencing of  BgFtz-f1  prevents normal molting and development of  B. germanica  [ 17 ], and  Ftz-f1  is involved in the regulation of  Leptinotarsa decemlineata ’s pupation by regulating 20E and JH titers [ 18 ].

For example, in an early study, gut inoculation of  Campylobacter jejuni  in mice has been reported to result in direct activation of the vagal sensory ganglia and the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) in the medulla oblongata ( Goehler  et al ., 2005 ).  Campylobacter jejuni  is the leading cause of bacterial diarrhoeal disease in many areas of the world ( Burnham and Hendrixson, 2018 ;  Malik  et al ., 2022 ) and its administration has been reported to induce anxiety-related behaviors ( Lyte et al., 2002 ).  Campylobacter jejuni  is also causally linked with the development of the autoimmune peripheral neuropathy Guillain Barré Syndrome (GBS) ( Malik  et al ., 2022 ). Such responses caused by  C .  jejuni  may be mediated by the vagal afferents. It is noteworthy to mention that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) may potentially serve as a therapeutic intervention for NDDs owing to its potent anti-inflammatory effects. Apart from the vagus nerve, the ENS, also acts as an essential mediator along the microbiota–gut–brain axis. Both animal experiments and cross-sectional studies have indicated that the ENS is involved in CNS disorders, especially in ASD, where GI comorbidities are frequently present ( Rao and Gershon, 2016 ). Current evidence suggests that microbes-derived metabolites are capable of regulating enteric neuron functions, such as the excitability of enteric nerve endings, affecting the endocrine as well as immune pathways in an indirect manner and consequently interacting with the CNS ( Vickers, 2017 ;  Agirman and Hsiao, 2021 ). This type of overlap and crosstalk is also discussed in other sections of the review.

CR6	Growing concerns over global plastic pollution have led to increased use of biodegradable bioplastics [ 1 ]. The market for biodegradable bioplastics is predicted to grow by 50% by 2025 [ 2 ]. The global bioplastic market was valued at USD 15.3 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow to USD 45.2 billion by 2029, indicating a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24.2% during this period. Despite the growing demand, the biodegradability and overall waste management of bioplastics are still being questioned. The complete degradation of bioplastics through any treatment process under aerobic and anaerobic conditions is not always guaranteed due to the difference between industrial and laboratory practices [ 3 ]. Moreover, most treatment plants are not specifically equipped for bioplastic processing, potentially leading to the contamination of digestate with macro and microplastic molecules, posing environmental hazards. A noteworthy example is Cellulose acetate (CA), derived from cellulose. Cellulose, sourced from sugarcane, wood, cotton, and recycled papers, can be converted into a polysaccharide ester like CA, which has become popular due to its desirable properties and sustainability [ 4 ,  5 ]. Cellulose is modified via acetylation, in which acetyl groups (-COCH3) replace hydrogen in the hydroxyl (-OH) groups of cellulose molecules to form CA. With efficient mechanical and thermal resistance, CA is utilized in diverse manufacturing practices, including syringe filters, photographic films, and cigarette filters (CF) [ 6 ].

IFN-γ secreted by T lymphocytes promotes the production of the antibody IgG2a and the differentiation of CD8 +  T cells into CTLs [ [28] ,  [29] ,  [30] ]. Similarly, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which is secreted by macrophages, is highly related to anti-tumor immunity [ [31] ,  [32] ,  [33] ] and can activate innate immunity [ 32 , 34 ]. In addition, IL-4 can regulate the production of the antibody IgG1, and promote the growth and differentiation of B cells and monocytes, as well as promote humoral immunity [ 35 , 36 ]. Other factors, such as IL-6, can participate in the regulation of cellular and humoral immune responses [ 35 , [37] ,  [38] ,  [39] ,  [40] ,  [41] ]. Here, ELISA was used to determine the levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-4, and IL-6 secreted by splenocytes after antigen restimulation. These cytokines represent important indexes for the successful induction of antitumor immune responses. As shown in  Fig. 6 E–H, compared with those in the OVA alone and plasma hydrogel groups, the levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-4 in the plasma/Mn hydrogel group were the highest. In addition, the levels of IL-6 in the plasma and plasma/Mn hydrogel groups were all significantly higher than those in the OVA alone group. These results indicate that plasma hydrogel can effectively enhance the immune response of OVA, while plasma hydrogel encapsulating Mn 2+  and OVA triggers strong cellular and humoral immunity.

Fluoxetine has been investigated in different preclinical models for its anti-inflammatory and anti-neuropathic activities [ 64 ]. Fluoxetine also improved cognition in a number of neurological disorders through a positive effect on neurogenesis by upregulation of BDNF. Fluoxetine is also reported to stimulate gliogenesis in the extra-hippocampal prefrontal cortex [ 10 ]. Fluoxetine blocks serotonin reuptake transporters (SERT) thereby increases the 5-HT concentration in the synaptic cleft. Thus elevated 5-HT interacts with the postsynaptic serotonin receptors for synthesizing BDNF by various cellular pathways [ 85 ].	Thus elevated 5-HT interacts with the postsynaptic serotonin receptors for synthesizing BDNF by various cellular pathways [ 85 ].	The study was planned to screen the marine actinobacterial extract for the protease inhibitor activity and its anti- Pf activity under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Out of 100 isolates, only 3 isolates exhibited moderate to high protease inhibitor activities on trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase K. Based on protease inhibitor activity 3 isolates were chosen for further studies. The potential isolate was characterized by polyphasic approach and identified as Streptomyces sp LK3 (JF710608). The lead compound was identified as peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3. The double-reciprocal plot displayed inhibition mode is non-competitive and it confirms the irreversible nature of protease inhibitor. The peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3 extract showed significant anti plasmodial activity (IC50: 25.78 µg/ml). In in vivo model, the highest level of parasitemia suppression (≈ 45%) was observed in 600 mg/kg of the peptide. These analyses revealed no significant changes were observed in the spleen and liver tissue during 8 dpi. The results confirmed up-regulation of TGF-β and down regulation of TNF-α in tissue and serum level in PbA infected peptide treated mice compared to PbA infection.

It promotes plant growth and development and plays a role in how plants react to environmental stresses. Ca 2+  is a ubiquitous secondary messenger that acts as a primary sensor and regulator of plants in dealing with growth, development, and varied environmental stressors [ 31 ]. Until now, CBPs also known as CAMTAs, and (SR) proteins, or ethylene (ET) induced (CBPs) have been shown to mediate the whole life cycles of multicellular eukaryotes, including plants and humans [ 6 ]. In plants, it is obvious that CAMTAs have 6 unique components, namely nuclear localization signals, which participate in targeting the protein in the nucleus, and the CG-1 domain [ 28 ]. Several CAMTAs genes have been identified from many plant species, including 6 AtCAMTAs in  A. thaliana , 10 VvCAMTAs in grape [ 15 ], 9 ZmCAMTAs in maize [ 14 ], 7 SlCAMTAs in tomato [ 18 ], 7 MsCAMTAs in alfalfa [ 32 ], 9 LuCAMTAs in flax [ 33 ], and 9 CsCAMTAs from citrus [ 34 ]. CAMTAs have been demonstrated to play significant roles in the maintenance of plant growth and development with different hormones under biotic and abiotic stress responses including low-temperature stress responses [ 35 , 36 ]. Extensive biochemical and genetic investigations have thoroughly clarified the role of Ca 2+  as a major nutrient in supporting the structural integrity of cell walls and influencing numerous physiological processes under biotic and abiotic stressors [ 7 , 37 ]. Ca 2+  spikes are typically the result of diametrically opposed events in cells: Ca 2+  influx (entry) through dedicated channels or Ca 2+  efflux (exit) through distinct pumps [ 38 ]. In fact, under a cold environment, elevated Ca 2+  levels could stimulate the interaction of CAMTAs with the cis-acting element, and then trigger the expression of numerous signaling transcriptions. So, The Ca 2+ /CaM complex modulates interactions between sensory stimuli and transcription, ( Figure 3 ), allowing plants to react immediately to cold exposure and to improve their cold adaptation and resistance [ 39 ]. CAMTAs itself is a group of transcription factors (TFs) that adjust plants when subject to cold or low stress in a Ca 2+ dependent manner. There is a significant amount of evidence that suggests Ca 2+  mediated signaling and tune CAMTAs, which are involved in the transmission of stress cues, such as light [ 40 , 41 ], temperature [ 42 ], salt [ 43 ], cold [ 44 ], oxidative signals [ 45 ], reactive oxygen species (ROS) [ 46 ], ET as a hormone signals [ 47 ], abscisic acid (ABA) [ 48 ], gibberellins (GA) [ 49 ], and auxins (IAA) [ 50 ], play a crucial part in plants under cold/low temperatures ( Table 1 ). According to Galon et al. (2010) AtCAMTA1-3 were negative regulators of auxin that linked to red light and high light responses, meanwhile AtCAMTA4-6 were considered to as positive integrators of auxin signaling and homeostasis [ 51 ]. Further study found that CAMTA1-3 may synergistically produce the maximum expressions of CBF1-3 after 2 h of 4 °C chilling treatment resulting in the up-regulation of more than 15% cold-regulated genes in the CBF independent mechanism and so strengthening  A. thaliana  freezing resistance [ 52 ]. Likewise, multiple stress-related cis-acting elements were found in the promoter sequences of various ZmCAMTA genes indicating that ZmCAMTAs play an important role in stress responses. ZmCAMTAs transcripts were significantly induced by maize rough dwarf disease infection with ZmCAMTA6/7a, exhibiting differential gene expression among disease-tolerant and disease-sensitive cultivars [ 14 ]. Apart from the AtCAMTAs, the functions of several CAMTAs in plants have been well investigated. Various stress and hormone treatments modulated the expression of eight CitCAMTAs genes in citrus [ 34 ]. The aforementioned information revealed the number of CAMTAs played a significant role in the maintenance of plant growth and development at environmental stimuli.

We then evaluated by comparing the mRNA expression levels of SCKM and normal tissues and discovered that most CRG expression levels were significantly associated with CNV alteration. CRGs with low and moderate CNV, such as PDHA1, DLAT, GLS, and LIAS, were overexpressed in CRC comparison to those in normal melanoma samples, whereas CRGs with high CNV, such as PDHB, were significantly increased in melanoma samples ( Figure 2D ), implying that CNV may regulate CRG mRNA expression. While CNV can explain many observed changes in CRG expression, it is not the only factor involved in expression level regulation ( 12 ). Other factors that can influence gene expression include DNA methylation and transcription factors ( 13 ,  14 ). Our findings revealed a significant difference in the genetic landscape and expression levels of CRGs between melanoma and control samples, revealing a latent role for CRGs in melanoma tumorigenesis.

Numerous researchers have questioned whether SCH and BD constitute 2 separate mental disorders due to their overlapping features ( 3 – 5 ). Euthymic patients with bipolar disorder still perform poorly on cognitive measures, which means that the impairment is not just limited to periods and residual stage of disease ( 6 – 9 ). The neurocognitive dysfunction that accompanies SCH is enduring ( 10 ,  11 ). Recent studies have found that a large number of BD patients have neurocognitive dysfunction too ( 12 ,  13 ). In contrast to BD, it is widely known that significant dysfunction is much more unique to SCH. For both SCH and BD, multiple candidate endophenotypes have been suggested ( 14 ,  15 ). This potential endophenotype for SCH is visual backward masking (VBM) ( 16 ) particularly the shine-through approach, and has a far greater sensitivity than most of the other cognitive and perceptual processes ( 17 ). A previous study indicated that visual backward masking deficiency is not unique to schizophrenia, but a larger range of functional psychosis. Both SCH and BD may suffer insufficient objective strengthening ( 18 ). A recent study showed that particular neurological functions can distinguish SCH from BD and also indicate a presumptive endogenous phenotype that can distinguish the genetic susceptibility of SCH from another severe psychological disease ( 19 ).

10.1007/s10900-017-0360-5	Parents’ expectations of high schools in firearm violence prevention	B75-ijerph-21-00534	This review found that the quality of patient–provider communication plays a crucial role in addressing barriers and facilitators to lung cancer screening participation. Our study provides additional insights into a provider’s ability to deliver information that may have the most influence. For example, if it is complicated to explain possible false positives, manage a patient’s worries, and when patients with low health literacy reported having difficulties understanding medical terms used during health professional recommendations [ 30 , 37 , 42 , 47 , 49 , 51 , 57 , 62 , 67 ]. In many cases, PCP did not make the conversion about lung cancer screening to high-risk people, and when they did, out of fear of causing a misunderstanding during a ‘risk–benefit conversation’ [ 36 , 50 , 62 ] or ‘ethical considerations’, the instructions provided were often insufficient [ 54 , 67 ] and the encounter time was inadequate [ 29 , 30 , 52 , 55 , 68 ]. Healthcare providers need to know how to work cancer screening into policies and procedures. Otherwise, it is not easy, and they will need more time for shared decision-making processes [ 70 , 75 ]. As shown in this review and other studies, the quality of patient–provider communication can significantly affect patients’ awareness, perception, and, ultimately, participation in lung cancer screening.	Healthcare providers need to know how to work cancer screening into policies and procedures. Otherwise, it is not easy, and they will need more time for shared decisionmaking processes  70 , 75 .	Firearm violence remains a significant problem in the US (with 2787 adolescents killed in 2015). However, the research on school firearm violence prevention practices and policies is scant. Parents are major stakeholders in relation to firearm violence by youths and school safety in general. The purpose of this study was to examine what parents thought schools should be doing to reduce the risk of firearm violence in schools. A valid and Related questionnaire was mailed to a national random sample of 600 parents who had at least one child enrolled in a public secondary school (response rate = 47%). Parents perceived inadequate parental monitoring/rearing practices (73%), peer harassment and/or bullying (58%), inadequate mental health care services for youth (54%), and easy access to guns (51%) as major causes of firearm violence in schools. The school policies perceived to be most effective in reducing firearm violence were installing an alert system in schools (70%), working with law enforcement to design an emergency response plan (70%), creating a comprehensive security plan (68%), requiring criminal background checks for all school personnel prior to hiring (67%), and implementing an anonymous system for students to report peer concerns regarding potential violence (67%). Parents seem to have a limited grasp of potentially effective interventions to reduce firearm violence.	10.3390/ijerph21050534	11121223	Unrelated

Although children are more resistant to the disease, the epidemic has affected various aspects of their daily life and may also affect their health and development ( 4 ,  6 ). In this regard, in addition to the economic effects caused by the tense labor market, the health measures required to deal with the COVID-19 disease have led to significant changes in the environments in which children grow and develop ( 4 ,  7 – 9 ).	In this regard, in addition to the economic effects caused by the tense labor market, the health measures required to deal with the COVID-19 disease have led to significant changes in the environments in which children grow and develop ( 4 ,  7 – 9 ).	The study was planned to screen the marine actinobacterial extract for the protease inhibitor activity and its anti- Pf activity under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Out of 100 isolates, only 3 isolates exhibited moderate to high protease inhibitor activities on trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase K. Based on protease inhibitor activity 3 isolates were chosen for further studies. The potential isolate was characterized by polyphasic approach and identified as Streptomyces sp LK3 (JF710608). The lead compound was identified as peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3. The double-reciprocal plot displayed inhibition mode is non-competitive and it confirms the irreversible nature of protease inhibitor. The peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3 extract showed significant anti plasmodial activity (IC50: 25.78 µg/ml). In in vivo model, the highest level of parasitemia suppression (≈ 45%) was observed in 600 mg/kg of the peptide. These analyses revealed no significant changes were observed in the spleen and liver tissue during 8 dpi. The results confirmed up-regulation of TGF-β and down regulation of TNF-α in tissue and serum level in PbA infected peptide treated mice compared to PbA infection. The results obtained infer that the peptide possesses anti- Pf activity activity.

These limitations suggest a pathway for the development of biosensors for cancer biomarker detection which are capable of showing a selective and sensitive immunological response. 7,8  This is beneficial as it reduces the cost of diagnosis and helps in fundamental understanding of cancer at an early stage. 9  In this context, extensive research has been carried out in recent years on point-of-care (POC) devices for the detection of oral cancer biomarkers. 8  Researchers in these fields tend to develop biosensing devices which combine an antibody as a recognition element with a transducer that converts an electrical signal into a measurable signal generated due to the interaction between the antigen and the antibody. 10,11	These limitations suggest a pathway for the development of biosensors for cancer biomarker detection which are capable of showing a selective and sensitive immunological response. 7,8  This is beneficial as it reduces the cost of diagnosis and helps in fundamental understanding of cancer at an early stage. 9  In this context, extensive research has been carried out in recent years on point-of-care (POC) devices for the detection of oral cancer biomarkers. 8  Researchers in these fields tend to develop biosensing devices which combine an antibody as a recognition element with a transducer that converts an electrical signal into a measurable signal generated due to the interaction between the antigen and the antibody. 10,11	Male moths compete to arrive first at a female releasing pheromone.

In addition, it had been used against viral infection [ 104 ]. Emodin is an anthraquinone compound derived from genus Rheum boosted protease inhibitor in the treatment of HIV infection. Lopinavir (LPV) is usually combined with ritonavir (RTV) to increase and Polygonum and it is also a virucidal agent [ 105 ]. Emodin could significantly block the interaction between the S protein of SARS-CoV and ACE2 [ 106 ]. Promazine, an anti-psychotic drug, shares a similar structure with emodin. It has been found to exhibit a significant effect in inhibiting the replication of SARS-CoV [ 107 ]. As compared to emodin, promazine exhibited potent inhibition of the binding of S protein to ACE2. These findings suggested that emodin and promazine might be able to inhibit SARS-CoV infectivity by blocking the interaction of S protein and ACE2. Therefore, the monoclonal antibody (scFv80R), chloroquine, emodin, and promazine could be used as choices for the treatment of COVID-19. Nicotianamine is an important metal-ligand in plants [ 108 ] and it is found a novel angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 inhibitor in soybean [ 109 ].

It has been reported that the selective free radical and inflammatory scavenging ability of H 2  is still widely acknowledged to be its mechanism, despite numerous errors. According to a prior study, the inhalation of H 2  has been found to prevent acute pancreatitis in rats, which was reported to be induced by caerulein. This could happen by preventing oxidative stress and premature inflammation [ 3 ]. Patients suffering from various chronic pulmonary diseases have been reported to respond well to H 2  treatment in clinical trials. This has confirmed that the therapeutic application of H 2  is both safe and effective [ 4 ] Moreover, the therapeutic and medicinal applications of H 2  have also been demonstrated in patients suffering from cardiac-arrest-related diseases due to oxidative stress and sports-related disorders [ 5 , 6 ]. Some of the therapeutic applications of hydrogen molecules have been given in  Figure 1 .

B7-biomedicines-11-01892	Post-COVID-19 syndrome’s symptoms are characterized by ongoing, disappearing, recurring or relapsing symptoms, developed over more than twenty days, followed by the development of infection. It can, however, manifest as severe, moderate or mild symptoms [ 15 , 16 , 17 ]. Individuals are likely to be predisposed to post-COVID-19 syndrome due to a combination of factors, including an overactive immune system, chronic inflammation, tissue damage brought on by infection, and stress resulting from the pandemic’s concurrent socioeconomic effects [ 18 , 19 ]. An accurate diagnosis of this condition is challenging, however, because of the viral infection’s resolution and the absence of serological antibodies [ 16 , 20 ]. Chronic fatigue, which has been reported in more than fifty percent (58%) of cases, cognitive deficits, myalgia, and dyspnea are among the common symptomatic manifestations [ 21 ]. The currently available data indicate that symptoms that make it difficult for patients to carry out daily tasks can affect up to 63% of individuals in post-COVID-19, of which 17.8% of patients were working before developing COVID-19 [ 7 ]. It was found that nosocomial patients tend to perform routine tasks less efficiently than outpatients [ 22 ]. Despite the initial appearance of mild symptoms, post-COVID-19 syndrome symptoms develop in children. According to compiled research, 10% of children aged 2 to 11 have one or more COVID-19-related persistent symptoms, and this number rises to 13% for adolescents aged 12 to 16 years old [ 7 ]. COVID-19 may be a factor in the post-COVID-19 syndrome’s persistent immune dysregulation and major organ dysfunction, because of the systemic inflammation and hyperactive immunological responses. Chronic fatigue, cognitive deficits, and cardio-respiratory dysfunction are the most common symptoms of post-COVID-19 syndrome. More than fifty percent of the reported cases indicate chronic fatigue, exertional fatigue, and OxS as the most prevalent symptoms. Research suggests that this condition is also characterized by persistent mitochondrial dysfunction, OxS, and inflammation. The symptoms of myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) and chronic fatigue (CFS) syndrome, which is a highly individualized disorder, can include cardiovascular distress (such as palpitations and irregular heartbeat), cognitive dysfunction (such as anxiety, confusion, decreased cognitive function, and forgetfulness), dizziness, and extreme fatigue. Since research on the long-term implications of H 2  on COVID-19 and/or SARS-CoV-2 infections is still in its early stages, this review analyses the recent studies and proposes its positive future prospects. Furthermore, the current review emphasizes the anti-apoptotic, antioxidative, and anti-inflammatory properties of hydrogen (H 2 ) molecules, as well as the underlying principle and fundamental mechanisms involved, with a prime focus on the coronavirus outbreak of 2019. This review will also provide strategies and recommendations for the therapeutic and medicinal applications of the hydrogen molecule.

ARDS is a life-threatening state that circumvents the entrance of oxygen into the lungs and circulation resulting in mortality and acute lung injury ( 140 ). Inflammatory action triggered by the release of excessive cytokines cause alveolar cell damage and necrosis ( 163 ). Enhanced endothelial and epithelial permeation facilitates the development of alveolar edema. Subsequently, alveolar barrier and osmotic gradient which promotes the clearance of alveolar fluid are disturbed. Necrosis and edema mediate a more robust immune response. Moreover, pulmonary edema prevents gas exchange and reduces carbon dioxide removal resulting in hypoxemia and acute respiratory failure ( 164 ). Approximately 20% of the infected patients developed hypoxia and ARDS leading to multiple organ failures ( 165 ). In fatal cases of Covid-19, patients encounter severe respiratory distress and need mechanical ventilation ( 140 ).

The ACE2 receptors are expressed in the respiratory tract and the cardiovascular, central nervous [ 9 ], and gastrointestinal systems [ 4 ] as well. Following the cell entrance and replication, the SARS-CoV-2 leads to pyroptosis, an inflammatory programmed cell death. In conjunction with the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), pyroptosis normally stimulates the limited and controlled release of inflammatory cytokines [ 10 ]. The excessive immune responses in some patients, however, leads to the cytokine storm and a tissue-wide damage, followed by septic shock and multiorgan (heart, liver, and kidney) damage [ 10 – 12 ].

Synthetic aptamers have been made to bind the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) specifically with high affinity using the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) competition-based approach. The small size of this biomolecule makes it a suitable candidate for a stable target in diagnostic techniques. The inhibitory potential of this small anti-RBD aptamer can be used in therapeutical treatments and diagnosis. Sensitive splint-based one-pot isothermal RNA detection (SENSR) is an RNA aptamer-based rapid detection approach. This technique works on the principle of ligation via SplintR ligase and T7 RNA Pol. The target RNA is amplified, and a fluorescent signal is detected. This single-step technique can detect a variety of pathogens with a detection limit of 0.1 aM [ 68 , 69 ].  Figure 4  illustrates the working of aptamer-based technology for detection of SARS-CoV-2.  Figure 4  illustrates the working of aptamer based technology for detection of SARS CoV-2 [ 70 ].

In different species like sheep [ 28 ,  29 ], goat [ 30 ] cattle [ 31 ], and pig [ 32 ], high-throughput technologies such as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) have efficiently been used in transcriptome analysis, molecular marker development, and gene discovery.	The study was planned to screen the marine actinobacterial extract for the protease inhibitor activity and its anti- Pf activity under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Out of 100 isolates, only 3 isolates exhibited moderate to high protease inhibitor activities on trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase K. Based on protease inhibitor activity 3 isolates were chosen for further studies. The potential isolate was characterized by polyphasic approach and identified as Streptomyces sp LK3 (JF710608). The lead compound was identified as peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3. The double-reciprocal plot displayed inhibition mode is non-competitive and it confirms the irreversible nature of protease inhibitor. The peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3 extract showed significant anti plasmodial activity (IC50: 25.78 µg/ml). In in vivo model, the highest level of parasitemia suppression (≈ 45%) was observed in 600 mg/kg of the peptide. These analyses revealed no significant changes were observed in the spleen and liver tissue during 8 dpi. The results confirmed up-regulation of TGF-β and down regulation of TNF-α in tissue and serum level in PbA infected peptide treated mice compared to PbA infection. The results obtained infer that the peptide possesses anti- Pf activity activity.

EPH Receptor A5 (EPHA5) was a candidate gene for body length in the present study. EPHA5 along with EFNA5 mediates communication between pancreatic islet cells to regulate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Insulin plays a key role in utilizing sugar in the body which is needed for proper growth, metabolism and tissue repair in the body secretions 24 – 26 . RhoBTB3 is proposed to have a role in the tissue development during embryonic life 27  while THEGL is involved in all stages of male gonads development such as sperm maturation, its fertilization and subsequent embryonic development. Moreover it has also been reported to have a high level of expression from adolescence to adulthood suggesting key role in the organs development and onset of puberty 28 . TLE4 supresses Pax7-mediated Myf5 transcriptional activation through inducing Myf5 enhancer to continue latency. Loss of TLE4 function results into Myf5 upregulation thus, showing its role in growth through transcription suppression 29 .

Liquid lipids make up nanoemulsions. Nanoemulsions, which have diameters smaller than visible wavelengths, are optically transparent in contrast to microemulsions, which scatter visible light many times and have an opaque white appearance (Vickers,  2017 ). The creation of functional foods has undergone a revolution thanks to nanoemulsions, which have opened up new ideas for nutrient encapsulation (Kumar & Sarkar,  2018 ). In addition to their nutritional value, food products also offer health‐promoting or preventative qualities. According to research, the synergy or connections of biologically active compounds and other essential nutrients present in food products account for the health‐promoting capacity of food stuff (Alshahrani,  2022 ). Furthermore, these bioactive chemicals might not be sufficient to maintain their effects due to their limited availability and long‐term sustainability.

B10-cells-12-02713	Cancer, a highly invasive and destructive disease, ranks as the second leading cause of death globally following cardiovascular diseases [ 1 ], particularly affecting developing countries with lower survival rates due to delayed diagnoses and limited treatment access. Current cancer treatments, including chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery, often encounter limitations such as severe side effects and harm to healthy tissues [ 2 ]. The primary treatment goal is complete cancer removal while minimizing damage to normal tissues. One of the significant hurdles in cancer therapy is drug resistance, which adversely affects patient survival rates and the effectiveness of anti-cancer drugs [ 3 ]. This resistance is multifaceted, involving factors like genetic mutations that promote various cancer cell populations and the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) [ 4 , 5 ]. CSCs, a subset of tumor cells with self-renewal abilities, play a critical role in tumor initiation and growth maintenance. Accumulating evidence has proved that CSCs are the driving force behind breast cancer [ 6 ] and glioblastoma (GBM) [ 7 ] tumor formation, progression, metastasis, therapeutic resistance, and recurrence. Therefore, targeting and eradicating these cells could potentially reduce the risk of relapse and contribute to better treatment outcomes [ 8 , 9 , 10 ].

B6-polymers-14-02561	In the human body, soft tissue refers to the tissue that connects, supports, and surrounds other structures. It includes muscles, tendons, ligaments, fascia, nerves fibrous tissue, fat, blood vessels, and synovial membranes. Regularly, soft tissue damage is caused by disease, congenital defects, trauma, and aging, which lead to the inability of the tissue to self-heal [ 1 ]. Due to this matter, an alternative technology called tissue engineering was proposed to help the healing process by regenerating or replacing the damaged tissue [ 2 ]. The important part of this method is the development of the scaffold, which is able to restore, maintain, and improve the function of tissue [ 3 ]. A scaffold is a template for tissue formation that allows the cells to migrate, adhere to, and produce tissue [ 4 ]. According to Li et al. [ 5 ], in the development of a successful and well-functioning scaffold, the following properties should be taken into account: (i) the biocompatibility and biodegradability of the scaffold in order to match the cell or tissue growth in vitro/vivo; (ii) suitable mechanical properties to match the tissue at the implantation site; (iii) proper surface chemistry for cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation activity. In addition, the architecture of the scaffold in terms of porosity is also necessary to consider as it is important for cell growth, nutrient transportation, and metabolic waste [ 6 , 7 ]. In applying the tissue engineering method, the scaffold must satisfy these properties.

B6-polymers-14-02561	The digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing technique is one of the best-defined techniques to produce scaffolds for soft tissue engineering. DLP is based on the basic principle of stereolithography (SLA), which offers better resolution and is more versatile than other conventional and additive manufacturing methods [ 8 ]. Practically, the DLP 3D printing process uses ultraviolet (UV) light to project the entire X and Y cross-sectional layers of the structure to be produced at one time onto a photopolymer resin, which will change the area exposed to UV light from a liquid to a solid. The solidified layer is formed on the collector, which is the Z axis, as shown in  Figure 1 . By using this process, the production time is reduced, which leads to higher productivity and reproducibility of the scaffold [ 9 , 10 , 11 ]. It is also able to create complex structures with highly accurate internal architecture as it has a high feature resolution [ 6 ]. Thus, this process can be used to develop the 3D structure of scaffolds with any kind of shape while maintaining good mechanical strength, and it can create a good environment for enhancing the biocompatibility performance [ 5 ]. However, it is worth noting that this method lacks resin as the resin must be capable of a photopolymerization reaction [ 12 ]. Therefore, UHT resin is used with the DLP 3D printer system. This resin is one of the standard bio-resins that can solidify quickly in the presence of a specific light source [ 11 ].

10.1371/journal.pone.0090972	Protease inhibitors from marine actinobacteria as a potential source for antimalarial compound	CR23	The overall carriage rate of ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae among children living with HIV was 19.9% (95% CI 14.4–26.1). The result was comparable to reports among healthy children (16%) [ 15 ] and (22%) [ 16 ] in Cameroon ,  21% Madagascar [ 17 ], (24.8%) Lebanon [ 18 ] and 16.8% Sweden [ 19 ]. On the other hand, the result was lower compared to reported results 31% in Niger [ 20 ], 34.3% Tanzania [ 21 ], 59% Central Africa Republic [ 22 ], 32.6% Guinea Bissau [ 23 ] and 49.6% Lebanon [ 24 ]. The fecal carriage of ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae in this study was a little higher than 13.7% in Zimbabwe [ 25 ] and higher than reports among HIV negative children from different geographic regions: (10%) in Kenya [ 26 ], (5.0%) Ghana [ 27 ], (3.5%) United States of America [ 28 ], (4.6%) France [ 29 ], (4.7%) South Africa [ 12 ]. Geographic variation, variation in the method of ESBL detection or measures taken for the prevention of antimicrobial resistance might be responsible for the difference.

The study was planned to screen the marine actinobacterial extract for the protease inhibitor activity and its anti- Pf activity under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Out of 100 isolates, only 3 isolates exhibited moderate to high protease inhibitor activities on trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase K. Based on protease inhibitor activity 3 isolates were chosen for further studies. The potential isolate was characterized by polyphasic approach and identified as Streptomyces sp LK3 (JF710608). The lead compound was identified as peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3. The double-reciprocal plot displayed inhibition mode is non-competitive and it confirms the irreversible nature of protease inhibitor. The peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3 extract showed significant anti plasmodial activity (IC50: 25.78 µg/ml). In in vivo model, the highest level of parasitemia suppression (≈ 45%) was observed in 600 mg/kg of the peptide. These analyses revealed no significant changes were observed in the spleen and liver tissue during 8 dpi. The results confirmed up-regulation of TGF-β and down regulation of TNF-α in tissue and serum level in PbA infected peptide treated mice compared to PbA infection. The results obtained infer that the peptide possesses anti- Pf activity activity. It suggests that the extracts have novel metabolites and could be considered as a potential source for drug development.	10.1186/s12981-021-00347-x	8061171	Unrelated

10.1371/journal.pone.0090972	Protease inhibitors from marine actinobacteria as a potential source for antimalarial compound	B67	One of the unique capabilities of VR is that visual information can be enhanced or manipulated during ongoing walking in a manner that is not possible in the real world, e.g., VEs can be used to manipulate visual cues to modulate the gait characteristics of patients with PD that provoke FoG and other impairments contributing to fall risk (Schubert et al.,  2005 ). For instance, Janeh et al. ( 2019a ) found that PD patients overcame the spatial asymmetry and exhibited a comparable step length by enlarging the step length of the short side, an adapted step time, and a swing time variability of both sides during the manipulation of visual-proprioceptive cues. Another example is by Barton et al. ( 2014 ) that has investigated the possibility of using the manipulation of visual cues with a time delay in a VE to alter gait using a Virtual Mirror Box. In their study, movements kinematics of the unimpaired leg were combined with the movement timing of the impaired leg to model a realistic avatar with a symmetric gait pattern. In addition, an extensive body of literature has examined the role of visual self-motion in the control of locomotion by selectively manipulating the direction or speed of the visual flow provided through the VE (Lamontagne et al.,  2007 ,  2010 ). VR can also be used to manipulate the locomotor trajectory of patients during overground walking that varied the path's radius of curvature, to assess the impact of an emulated knee disability on the locomotor trajectory. Gérin-Lajoie et al. ( 2010 ). In many studies (Chou et al.,  2009 ; Janeh et al.,  2017a , b ,  2018 ), where they manipulated the translation gain of walking in healthy younger and older adults, so that one step forward in the physical world corresponds to several steps forward in the VE. In contrast, Matsumoto et al. ( 2018 ) examined the effect of curvature and bending gains ( Figure 5d ) on walking biomechanics, which occurs when the curvature of the walking path in the VE was manipulated, while the actual walking path remains constant. Therefore, using VR to manipulate visual flow thus has the potential to alter the interaction space and provide notable information about locomotion speed and heading to the patient (Warren et al.,  2001 ; Turano et al.,  2005 ). Walking trajectory was shown to be affected when healthy young subjects were exposed to rotational, translational or a combination of both, demonstrating the importance of visual flow on steering behavior during locomotion (Sarre et al.,  2008 ). Additionally, if the same rotational optic flow is generated via a simulated camera rotation in VE against an actual head rotation, a different locomotor behavior also emerges, whereby the simulated but not the actual head rotation results in a trajectory deviation (Hanna et al.,  2017 ). Such findings support the potential contribution of the motor command in heading estimation (Banks et al.,  1996 ; Crowell et al.,  1998 ). These findings also corroborate the presence of multisensory integration of both visual and non-visual information (i.e., vestibular, proprioceptive, and somatosensory) to generate a single representation of self-motion and orientation in space (Karthik et al.,  2014 ; Acerbi et al.,  2018 ).

CR40	Pharmaceutical pollutants, specifically painkillers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen, are a growing environmental concern due to their presence in wastewater treatment plants and natural water systems and their potential to harm aquatic life and human health. These pollutants are not entirely removed during wastewater treatment and their continuous release can lead to antibiotic-resistant bacteria, presenting a challenge to public health. Hence, it is essential to develop effective methods for their removal from wastewater and monitor their occurrence and transportation in natural water systems 39 , 40 . This study introduces a novel solution to the increasing environmental concern of pharmaceutical pollutants, particularly painkillers such as aspirin, paracetamol, ibuprofen, and diclofenac, which are commonly detected in natural water systems. The researchers designed porous 2D membranes based on Clar’s Goblet, named Clar’s goblet membranes (CGMs), to function as a highly sensitive sensor for these pollutants. The study investigates the electronic, adsorption, optical, and interaction properties of CGMs with these drugs, estimating the adsorption energy and electronic energy gap. The results reveal a redshift in the absorption spectra of CGM1-drug complexes, confirming the absorption of these painkillers on the surface of CGMs. The study's findings suggest that CGMs have the potential to be an efficient and Related sensor for pharmaceutical pollutants, with possible applications in wastewater treatment and environmental monitoring.

In the local network of the conductance-based neurons, we observe multiscale spiking features, including asynchronous irregular, synchronous regular and power-law neuronal avalanches. These findings seem to be meaningful because the similar co-emergence of rich cortical activities has been observed in both experimental and computational recordings  [13] . In particular, we show that fast-acting synapses modulate spiking behaviors in a wide dynamic range, and give rise to synchronous firing of neurons only in the mean-dominated regime. In contrast, the fast-acting synapse has little effect on the modulation of neuronal bursting events under a fluctuation-dominated background current. In this scenario, it appears that the influence of synaptic coupling is relatively weaker compared to the background current. The network tends to exhibit stationary firing activity and remains in focus in the dynamical regime. This suggests that the network dynamics are primarily driven by the background current rather than chemical synaptic interactions  [34] .

Numerous findings indicate that autophagy plays an important role in the biology and pathology of keratinocytes ( 177 ). It has already been seen that calcipotriol, a vitamin D analog, has the ability to induce autophagy in keratinocytes ( 178 ). Analogous vitamin D molecules have been used to treat different skin diseases, such as psoriasis, lamellar ichthyosis and epidermolytic hyperkeratosis ( 179 ). The autophagic pathway converges with the vitamin D3-cathelicidin pathway, which is preferably seen in the paucibacillary form of leprosy ( 140 ,  141 ). Vitamin D3 induces autophagy  via  cathelicidin in macrophages infected with  M. tuberculosis , with cathelicidin being required for IFNγ-mediated antimicrobial activity ( 180 ,  181 ).

These pollutants can be inorganic, Organic or organo-metallic in type and among them, persistent organic pollutants are absolutely toxic to human and other animals [ 12 ]. Organic dyes are a type of these persistent organic pollutants. Though these dyes are used in different industries such as textiles, cosmetics, leather tanning, paper, pharmaceutical, plastic and practical laboratories of schools, colleges, Universities and the others, they are highly toxic to human and other organisms if not properly managed and if they let out to the environment [ 13 ]. There were different techniques applied over the last decades like adsorption [ [14] ,  [15] ,  [16] ,  [17] ,  [18] ,  [19] ,  [20] ], flocculation [ 18 , 21 ], chemical oxidation [ 22 ], coagulation [ 23 ], and ion exchange method [ 24 ] for the removal of toxic organic pollutants.

CR94	Immunologically, CTC clusters possess the unique ability to aggregate with different immune cells (heterotypic clusters), which act as a physical shield, providing a protective barrier against immunological surveillance. Interestingly, it has been discovered that neutrophils, a subtype of white blood cell, directly interact with breast CTCs, influencing the transcriptional profile of tumor cells, promoting the progression of the cell cycle in the blood, and hastening the seeding of metastases. Studies have indicated that individuals diagnosed with BC who presented with a minimum of one CTC cluster containing neutrophils had a significantly poorer prognosis than those with less than five CTCs in a volume of 7.5 ml of peripheral blood [ 60 ]. Indeed, heterotypic clusters in BC can metastasize quickly due to the presence of stroma-derived cells and platelets [ 94 ]; the latter coats clusters as a physical shield to protect them from shear forces in the circulation, collisions with other blood cells, and immunological reactions mediated by cytotoxic natural killer (NK) and T cells [ 61 ]. Additionally, this aggregation can facilitate CTC migration through the endothelial barrier by improving their adherence to the vasculature [ 95 ].

This process is fundamental to developing intrinsic heterogeneity in CTCs [ 96 ]. Predominantly, Cancer cells initially colonize through a reversible process known as a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), which facilitates their colonization in metastatic foci [ 97 ]. The CTC cluster exhibits both epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics simultaneously in MBC patients [ 98 ,  99 ]; the hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal phenotype that is observed endows these aggregates with a considerable degree of plasticity, thereby conferring a trait of advantageous survival, as has been proposed in the literature [ 100 ].

Edematous interstitial tissue with scattered Leydig cells and crowded thick-walled arterioles with narrowing lumens. There was also a noticeable expansion of interstitial spaces, which were closed by Leydig cells' cytoplasmic vacuolization. The current study's histopathologic changes corroborate prior research that found comparable age-related changes ( Vickers, 2017 ). Germ cell loss was linked to the existence of seminiferous epithelial vacuoles ( Pop et al., 2011 ), while abnormal germ cells phagocytosed by Sertoli cells linked to Sertoli cell cytoplasm vacuolization ( Gunes et al., 2016 ). With ageing, the presence of vacuoles suggested a decline in Sertoli cell biological activity ( Jiang et al., 2014 ,  Santiago et al., 2019 ). Ultrastructural findings revealed expanded areas next to basement membranes, indicating spermatogonia germ cell loss, as well as substantial vacuolization of the neighboring Sertoli cells, indicating that seminiferous epithelium vacuolization is multifactorial. The occurrence of phagocytosed necrotic germ cells in Sertoli cell cytoplasm raised the possibility that this was one of reasons of Sertoli cell vacuolization. In elderly adults, disruption of the Sertoli-to-Sertoli junction associated to abnormal spermatogenesis and weakening of immunological barrier provided by blood testis barrier ( Jiang et al., 2014 ,  Santiago et al., 2019 ). In concomitant with histopathological alterations observed in ( Hussein et al., 2020 ) research, in senile Brown Norway rats, regressed tubules with degraded germ cells and wide intercellular gaps were discovered ( LEVY et al., 1999 ). One interesting result noted in ( Hussein et al., 2020 ) study was elevated in Leydig cells number in interstitium around atrophic tubules. Other investigators found elevated in Leydig cells number and size with aging ( Dakouane et al., 2005 ,  Xu et al., 2013 ). The elevated size and number of Leydig cells revealed a compensatory action of aged testicular tissue, unfortunately nonfunctioning.	The current study's histopathologic changes corroborate prior research that found comparable age-related changes ( Vickers, 2017 ).	Male moths compete to arrive first at a female releasing pheromone.

10.1016/j.cub.2017.05.064	No title	cit52	Numerous materials are used in the composition of nanocomposites based on AuNPs, which are applied for different purposes. In other words, nanocomposites are used to achieve more effective compositions. In the following, some of the most important ones will be introduced. It has been reported that chitosan-based AuNP composites have better stability against aggregation compared to citrate-stabilized AuNPs. 49,50  Additionally, chitosan increases the biodegradability and cytocompatibility of the composite, whereas AuNPs improve the electronic, optical, mechanical, and catalytic properties of the composite. 49,50  Chitosan can perform as a reducing agent and control the hydrolysis rate in producing oligosaccharide-based nanocomposites. Moreover, in aqueous solutions, oligosaccharides have greater mobility than polymers. Therefore, Au( iii ) is more dispersed in the presence of chitosan oligosaccharides, inhibiting aggregation events. 51  Chitosan derivatives with electron-donor groups show higher efficiency in coordinating with Au( iii ) ions than unmodified chitosan. Besides, unmodified chitosan can reduce Au( iii ) through a complex procedure  via  hydrolysis. 52  In recent years, metal-based nanoparticles, such as copper, gold, silver, platinum, and palladium, have been extensively used in medical approaches. 53,54  Though, along with their advantages, metal-based nanoparticles have deficiencies that limit their helpful application. For instance, platinum and palladium nanoparticles are bacteriostatic, but their high cost and material shortage are the main problems. 55,56  Additionally, silver nanoparticles have different antibacterial mechanisms, but their cytotoxicity restricts their practical application. 12,56  Combinations of metal nanoparticles may improve these limitations and disadvantages. 12  As an illustration, due to the action of solid electron ligands, the interaction between gold and silver nanoparticles can increase their antibacterial activity and enhance the effective concentration range. 12  Surprisingly, adding a third metal can sometimes provide more improvement. 12  Therefore, according to several studies, the simultaneous use of several nanoparticles with AuNPs increases the antibacterial activity of nanocomposites and significantly reduces the toxicity of the nanoparticles.

No DOI	Protease inhibitors from marine actinobacteria as a potential source for antimalarial compound	bibr40-09636897231200059	Loss of function is an important approach for studying gene function. We next proceeded to establish an electroporation-based, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated method to knockout/knockdown targeted gene in EGCs of the axolotl brains. It has been reported that electroporation of CAS9-gRNA could be applied to knockdown targeted gene in the spinal cord of the axolotls. In terms of target gene, we chose  TnC , one of the genes detected to be up-regulated in EGCs adjacent to lesion during brain regeneration by spatial transcriptomics 6 , 39 , 40  ( Fig. 6A , top panel). In this experiment, we chose tyrosinase ( Tyr ) gene as the control, which is considered playing no or non-essential roles in the central nervous system, and has been used as a control for gene knockout experiments in previous publications 16 , 41 , 42 . mRNA ISH using an antisense probe indeed showed a similar expression regulation of  TnC  in brain regeneration ( Fig. 6A , bottom panel). To knock down  TnC , we first injected the pre-assembled CAS9-gRNA complex mixture against  TnC  into the telencephalic lumen, followed by electroporation orientated to the dorsal domain of the left telencephalon. We then carried out brain injury at 2 days post electroporation and collected regenerating brains at 5 days post brain injury ( Fig. 6B ,  C ). mRNA ISH showed that  TnC  expression was dramatically down-regulated in EGCs adjacent to the injury site upon electroporation of CAS9-gRNA mixture 2, but not so obvious with mixture 1, when compared to that in the control ( Fig. 6D ). Furthermore, when carried out immunofluorescence using an antibody against TnC, we observed similar phenotypes, except that the reduction of the protein level is more dramatic than mRNA upon electroporation of CAS9-gRNA mixture 2 ( Fig. 6E ), leading to more clear loss of protein than mRNA. To evaluate the efficacy of the gRNAs in inducing the  TnC  genome modification, we conducted genotyping after electroporating CAS9-gRNA complexes into the axolotl spinal cord. The sequencing analysis revealed that the gRNAs were capable of inducing indels  in vivo  at the targeted  TnC  loci ( Supplemental Fig. S7 ). Among all animals that were electroporated with  TnC  gRNAs, 75% exhibited knockdown in electroporated brain area ( n  = 8), while none in the control group showed knockdown ( n  = 4) ( Supplemental Table S3 ). It suggested that electroporation of CAS9-gRNA could efficiently knockdown targeted gene.	In terms of target gene, we chose  TnC , one of the genes detected to be up-regulated in EGCs adjacent to lesion during brain regeneration by spatial transcriptomics 6 , 39 , 40  ( Fig. 6A , top panel).	The study was planned to screen the marine actinobacterial extract for the protease inhibitor activity and its anti- Pf activity under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Out of 100 isolates, only 3 isolates exhibited moderate to high protease inhibitor activities on trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase K. Based on protease inhibitor activity 3 isolates were chosen for further studies. The potential isolate was characterized by polyphasic approach and identified as Streptomyces sp LK3 (JF710608). The lead compound was identified as peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3. The double-reciprocal plot displayed inhibition mode is non-competitive and it confirms the irreversible nature of protease inhibitor. The peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3 extract showed significant anti plasmodial activity (IC50: 25.78 µg/ml). In in vivo model, the highest level of parasitemia suppression (≈ 45%) was observed in 600 mg/kg of the peptide. These analyses revealed no significant changes were observed in the spleen and liver tissue during 8 dpi. The results confirmed up-regulation of TGF-β and down regulation of TNF-α in tissue and serum level in PbA infected peptide treated mice compared to PbA infection. The results obtained infer that the peptide possesses anti- Pf activity activity. It suggests that the extracts have novel metabolites and could be considered as a potential source for drug development.	10.1177/09636897231200059	10510365	Unrelated

Although there are many clay-based materials, attapulgite, kaolinite, sepiolite, bentonite, and contaminated clays have been investigated as rheological modifier agents for cementitious materials [ 198 , 199 , 200 , 201 , 202 , 203 , 204 , 205 , 206 , 207 ] Many studies [ 30 , 40 , 85 , 204 , 208 , 209 , 210 , 211 , 212 ] carried out in this area have reported that the proper dosage of nanoclay can significantly ameliorate the thixotropy of cementitious composites. This phenomenon can be ascribed to the flocculation effect of clay nanoparticles [ 201 , 213 , 214 , 215 ]. On the other hand, Quanji et al. [ 40 ] found that the incorporation of nanoclay more than the proper quantity (higher than 1.3% of cement mass) decreases the thixotropy rate.

B31-polymers-14-02270	To avoid the critical problem of the high corrosion rate of mild steel, fiber-reinforced polymers (FRPs) are proposed as a potential alternative material due to their superior corrosion resistance and competent mechanical properties. Fiber-reinforced concrete also can resist corrosion and allow the direct utilization of sea sand and seawater as efficient and economical construction materials for marine structures [ 9 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 ]. FRP materials exhibit several properties, such as lightweight, and high tensile strength, making them suitable for structural reinforcement [ 18 ]. Different types of FRP, such as Carbon FRPs, Aramid FRPs, Glass FRPs, and Basalt FRPs, are available as common replacements for conventional steel reinforcement. FRPs have been subjected to experimental investigation for decades for their durability assessment. FRPs are reported to have the highest retention of tensile strength subjected to the highly alkaline solution [ 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 ]. Several factors shall be considered, including the performance advantage, materials cost, and application field, before using FRP. For instance, CFRP has better mechanical properties, and fatigue/creep/corrosion resistance. However, its high material price and low elongation at break are the main disadvantages. In contrast, GFRP and BFRP have a higher elongation at break and lower price, but their mechanical, corrosive, and creep properties are relatively poor, especially exposed to an alkaline environment [ 26 , 27 , 28 ]. Moreover, CFRP is highly recommended for higher flexure strength of RC beams, improved confinement, and lower deflection compared to GFRP and BFRP [ 17 , 29 ]. The performance of GFRP beams improves with the addition of steel bars. Crack width and mid-span deflection decreased by increasing the reinforcement ratio, whereas the load-carrying capacity was increased [ 30 , 31 ]. GFRP and CFRP showed superior effects on the load-carrying capacity, stiffness, and energy absorption of RC structural elements compared with conventional steel reinforcement [ 32 ].	Crack width and mid-span deflection decreased by increasing the reinforcement ratio, whereas the load-carrying capacity was increased [ 30 , 31 ].

28743020	No title	cit46	The magnetic properties of Fe-CB were measured using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) before and after use, as shown in  Fig. 4b . The fresh Fe-CB had a saturation magnetization of 1.42 emu g −1 , which only slightly decreased to 1.38 emu g −1  after use. This indicates that the catalyst retained most of its magnetic properties during the degradation process. Retentivity, which refers to a material's ability to retain its magnetization after an external magnetic field is removed, was nearly unchanged before and after use, with values of −0.385 and −0.384 emu g −1 , respectively. These results suggest that the Fe-CB material has a soft magnetic behavior that is easily reversed. Coercivity, which measures the strength of the external magnetic field required to demagnetize a material, was 365 Oe and 355 Oe for fresh and used Fe-CB, respectively. The observed non-zero coercivity values in the Fe-CB catalyst samples may be due to the presence of larger particles, while most smaller particles exhibit superparamagnetic behavior. 46  These results indicate that the Fe-CB catalyst has low remanence and low coercivity, making it easy to separate with an external magnetic field, as shown in the inset of  Fig. 4b .

Cadmium is one of the most hazardous metals for a variety of food crops, particularly maize, and it has been shown to limit crop growth by disrupting normal cellular activities and metabolism [ 1 , 12 ]. Changes in morpho-physiological development and antioxidant enzyme activities in maize caused by cadmium also led to oxidative stress in maize due to an increase in reactive oxygen species generation (ROS) [ 1 , 13 ]. Moreover, it was observed that Cd toxicity decreased maize photosynthetic pigments, antioxidant enzyme activity, and morphological growth [ 14 ]. Maize is an essential crop in agricultural production, but the soil in China is currently polluted by Cd in many regions, leading to the enhancement of Cd content [ 15 ]. Consequently, it is imperative that scientists figure out how to reduce the amount of Cd in crops grown in polluted areas.

CR66	While circRNAs function as noncoding RNAs and typically lack the 5ʹ cap, 3ʹ poly (A) tail, or clear open reading frame (ORF) required for translational regulation, recent studies have shown that they can indeed code for proteins [ 64 ]. CircRNAs can not only bind proteins but also function as miRNA sponges and interacting parts of polymerase II complexes. This process is facilitated by a specific sequence that allows the incorporation of an artificial internal ribosome entry site (IRES) upstream of the start codon, which immediately initiates translation through the ribosome [ 65 ]. In addition, the presence of N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-methylated adenosine residues that bind directly to eIF3 has been shown to facilitate circRNA translation [ 64 ]. CircZNF609, a distinct regulator of myogenic cell proliferation, is a typical example. It features an ORF that has the same start codon as its linear equivalent and a stop codon in the ORF that is a product of backsplicing at the termination point. Association with heavy polysomes converts CircZNF609 into a protein in a manner that is both splice-dependent and cap-independent, shedding light on the occurrence of protein-coding circRNAs in eukaryotes [ 66 ]. In addition, Zhang and his team made a breakthrough discovery: circSHPRH is able to synthesize a new functional protein, SHPRH-146A, which plays an important role as a tumor suppressor in glioblastoma [ 67 ].

The lead compound was identified as peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3. The double-reciprocal plot displayed inhibition mode is non-competitive and it confirms the irreversible nature of protease inhibitor. The peptide from Streptomyces sp LK3 extract showed significant anti plasmodial activity (IC50: 25.78 µg/ml). In in vivo model, the highest level of parasitemia suppression (≈ 45%) was observed in 600 mg/kg of the peptide. These analyses revealed no significant changes were observed in the spleen and liver tissue during 8 dpi. The results confirmed up-regulation of TGF-β and down regulation of TNF-α in tissue and serum level in PbA infected peptide treated mice compared to PbA infection. The results obtained infer that the peptide possesses anti- Pf activity activity.

Nursing is a stressful profession that deals with human aspects of health and illness and can ultimately lead to job dissatisfaction and burnout. The profession is not only physically demanding as it deals with human health and functions but also necessitates the use of mental energy and leads to mental exhaustion when one is continuously exposed to stressful events and situations. This mental exhaustion is what partly defines burnout (Lambert et al.,  2018 ; Moukarzel et al.,  2019 ). Burnout is a condition of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and low personal accomplishment that can occur among individuals who work with people in some capacity (Zhang,  2018 ). The emotional exhaustion component is characterized by loss of emotional resources and energy, lack of enthusiasm, frustration, tension and fatigue. The depersonalization component represents the interpersonal relationships that lead to a negative interaction, and the sense of low personal accomplishment refers to feelings of incompetence (Karthik et al.,  2019 ). Generally speaking, burnout can occur as a result of the presence of job demands like work overload, prolonged working hours, nurse–patient ratio imbalance, role conflict, lack of fairness, conflict in values and job resources such as a lack of social support from colleagues or management, lack of feedback, and poor participation in decision making (Ren et al.,  2020 ). Burnout represents a high cost to workers and their institutions and appears to be more common in developing than in developed countries (Shanafelt et al.,  2020 ). The World Health Organization (WHO) recently declared burnout as an “occupational phenomenon” in the International Classification of Disease 11th revision (ICD‐11), recognizing burnout as a serious health issue worldwide (Woo et al.,  2020 ). Other evidence also suggests that burnout in nurses is high across specialties and countries (Ling,  2019 ). Globally, the overall prevalence of burnout among nurses is 11.23%, but significant differences have been noted between geographical regions and specialties. The sub‐Saharan African region had the highest burnout symptom prevalence rate, whereas Europe and Central Asia region had the lowest (Woo et al.,  2020 ). A systematic review conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa showed that the prevalence of burnout among nurses was 33% (Owuor et al.,  2020 ). Some of the consequences of job burnout are absenteeism, low morale or personal deterioration, stress, anxiety, psychosomatic complaints, sleep disturbances and poor organizational commitment (Torun & Cavusoglu,  2018 ). Burnout not only affects physical and mental abilities but also affects the individual's health (Fradelos et al.,  2019 ). Therefore, the identification and prevention of burnout play an important role in improving the quality of services provided (Bakker & Costa,  2021 ).	Some of the consequences of job burnout are absenteeism, low morale or personal deterioration, stress, anxiety, psychosomatic complaints, sleep disturbances and poor organizational commitment Torun  Cavusoglu, 2018 .

It was thought that a longer contact period would allow greater cellular permeabilization, so DIMCARB was used to infiltrate and disintegrate the cellular structure of  Chlorella pyrenoidosa.  Incubation for 90 min did not increase the lipid yield.  Chlorella  sp cell wall. is composed of cellulose, xylans and mannan compounds, with numerous chains of -linked  d -glucose units formed between oxygen atoms and hydrogen networks [ 27 ]. It was hypothesized that DIMCARB, a polar and hydrophilic IL, would make it easier for hydrogen bonds to form and deprotonate the cellulose chain in the  C. pyrenoidosa  cell wall. This makes it easier for the lipid to dissolve into the solvent by weakening the cellulose of the encysted  Chlorella  sp cell. Furthermore, the amount of lipid that can diffuse from the microalgal cells to the solvent may be limited by the maximal mass transfer of lipids between the inner and outer walls of  Chlorella  sp 's  cellular structure. For these reasons, 75 min was determined to be the best time.

Ticks serve as vectors and reservoirs of many pathogens of medical and veterinary concern, including several zoonotic pathogens [ 5 ]. Of the approximately 949 identified tick species worldwide, 10% are vectors of pathogens that cause diseases of public health and veterinary concern [ 6 ,  7 ]. Almost 30 tick species in Pakistan have been identified from cattle and buffaloes and 40 from sheep and goats [ 9 ]. In addition, more than 80% of bovines were tick-infested with  Hyalomma  and  Rhipicephalus  genera species alone.  Hyalomma anatolicum  and  Rhipicephalus microplus  are the most common tick species collected from the livestock of Pakistan and the primary vectors of the causative pathogens of babesiosis, theileriosis, and anaplasmosis in ruminants [ 1 ].  R .  microplus  (cattle tick) is a vector for  Anaplasma marginale ,  Babesia bigemina , and  B .  bovis , causative agents of tick fever in livestock.  H .  anatolicum  is a proficient vector for  Theileria annulata , which causes theileriosis, resembling malaria in animals [ 8 ].  Hy .  anatolicum  is also responsible for transmitting Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (CCHFV), which results in a disease (CCHF) with a 30% fatality rate [ 9 ]. Zoonotic tick-borne diseases (TBDs), especially anaplasmosis, babesiosis, and ehrlichiosis, can be transmitted to humans via tick bites during practices like removing ticks from animal bodies or crushing of removed ticks with bare hands and possibly through contact with blood or tissues of infected animals [ 10 ].

CR8	In the lyophilisation technique, RNA solvent, which is diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated deionized water, is typically removed from frozen sample via sublimation [ 1 ]. Lyophilisation possesses two types of stresses namely, freezing and drying both of which are known to damage nucleic acids such as non-viral vectors or plasmid DNAs. [ 1 ]. It is an applicable tool for tissue samples rich in polyphenols and polysaccharides because it diminishes the RNA contamination mediated by nuclease and protease activities [ 2 ]. Moreover, RNA stabilization of tissues at non-cryogenic temperatures applying cell-penetrable fixatives such as RNAlater for short-term storage has recently been used as an alternative technique [ 8 ]. Air-drying of RNA in a suspension of yeast at 50 °C resulted in a nucleic acid (about 5% of that initially present) characterized by a relatively high ratio of adenine/guanine [ 9 ]. The mRNA is also conserved on rehydration after complete drying of drought-tolerant moss  Tortula ruralis  (Hedw.) [ 10 ].

Nearly every form of neurological disorder, including multiple sclerosis, stroke, AD, PD, and spinal cord injury, is a result of neuroinflammation [ 101 ]. The nigrostriatal dopaminergic system of the animal brain is affected by neuroinflammation as the disease progresses, as evidenced by glial cell activation, increases in proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ), and enzymes ((iNOS, COX-2), as well as protein aggregation, inflammasome activation, and cell death [ 94 ,  174 ,  176 ], Zhang and An, 2007).

CR13	The World Health Organization (WHO) defines domestic violence as any violent and gender-dependent behavior causing damage or possible physical, sexual, emotional damage, or suffering for women. Such behaviors can occur with threats, as well as absolute deprivation of liberty and freedoms, and may occur implicitly or explicitly [ 11 ]. Worldwide, 30 % of women experience physical or sexual violence by their partner throughout their life [ 12 ]. Pregnancy alone imposes considerable psychological and physical stress on a woman, and when accompanied by other stress factors such as violence, they can adversely affect the health of mother and child. All said complications can increase maternal and neonatal mortality [ 1 ,  2 ]. Exposure to domestic violence during pregnancy is associated with numerous adverse consequences including prenatal bleeding, trauma to the fetus, congenital infection, uterine infection, atraumatic rupture of the spleen and pneumothorax, abortion, stillbirth, and premature delivery [ 13 ]. The negative consequences of psychological health including depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, suicide, delayed visits for pregnancy care, maternal malnutrition, as well as drug abuse and chronic alcohol consumption, are associated with domestic violence during pregnancy [ 14 ].

B9-molecules-27-00441	The textile industry has globally undeniable importance as it contributes to 7% of the total world exports. In spite of the great importance of this industrial sector, the drainage of untreated effluents into water bodies causes serious environmental problems [ 1 , 2 ]. Dyes are considered complex, poisonous, and low biodegradable structures; hence, different techniques have been developed to purify industrial wastewater from these organic pollutants. Methods including membrane filtration, degradation, chemical oxidation, electrochemical treatment, reverse osmosis, ion exchange, and adsorption have been applied to remove pollutants from water [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ]. The advantages of simplicity, high efficiency, and low cost give the adsorption method priority among other technologies [ 8 , 9 , 10 ]. Until now, various adsorbents have been proposed to remove dyes and heavy metals from wastewater such as carbon materials [ 11 ], zeolites [ 12 ], clay minerals [ 13 ], and hydrogel [ 14 ]; after the completion of the adsorption process, adsorbents are separated from the medium using filtration or centrifugation. These processes are time- or energy-consuming and may lead to loss of the adsorbent’s mechanical properties. Furthermore, some adsorbents in the nanoscale are hardly separated from the adsorption solution, which may have harmful consequences [ 15 ].

28743020	Animal communication: when i'm calling you, will you answer too?	bib58	The function of lncRNAs in the differentiation of HSPCs has been investigated in numerous studies. LncRNAs can regulate expression of transcription factors which regulate hematopoiesis. Luo et al. have assessed lncRNA profile of HSCs by high throughput sequencing and recognized more than 300 unannotated lncRNAs. Comparison of expression of these lncRNAs in differentiated lineages has led to identification of 159 HSC-enriched lncRNAs (LncHSCs). Silencing of two LncHSCs has conferred specific impact on HSC self-renewal and lineage commitment possibly through modulation of principal hematopoietic transcription factor, namely E2A [ 41 ]. Expression of the transcription factor PU.1 has been controlled by an antisense lncRNA which is transcribed from the same locus namely PU.1-AS. This lncRNA has been shown to suppress  PU.1  expression through regulating its translation [ 42 ]. Notably, others have described that high level of PU.1 is required for the development of macrophage compared with neutrophils [ 43 ]. Therefore, fine-tuning of PU.1 expression by its antisense transcript might define the lineage development. Paralkar et al. have identified more than 1000 polyadenylated lncRNAs expressed in erythroblastic cells, megakaryocytes, and megakaryocyte-erythroid precursor cells of mouse, and about 600 lncRNAs in human erythroblasts. The majority of these lncRNAs have been shown to be controlled by chief transcription factors including GATA1 and TAL1 [ 44 ]. Wagner et al. have reported over-expression of EGO in human bone marrow and in mature eosinophilic cells. This lncRNA has been shown to be transcribed from an intronic region of the  ITPR1  gene. Stimulation of CD34 +  hematopoietic progenitors with IL-5 has enhanced expression of EGO. EGO knock down has reduced expression of MBP and EDN in developing CD34 +  hematopoietic progenitors [ 45 ]. HOTAIRM1 is another antisense transcript originating from the same CpG island that is around the initiation site of  HOXA1  gene. HOTAIRM1 is the most noticeable intergenic RNA which is over-expressed in the course of induced granulocytic differentiation of hematopoietic cells. This lncRNA contributes in the myelopoiesis cia regulation of HOXA cluster [ 46 ]. Expression of Fas-AS1 has also been induced in the course of erythropoiesis via the activity of important erythroid transcription factors GATA-1 and KLF1. This lncRNA is inhibited by NF-κB. Besides, up-regulation of Fas-AS1 in HSPCs-originated erythroblasts has decreased surface levels of Fas and induced defense against Fas-mediated apoptosis [ 47 ]. LincRNA-EPS has a role in the erythroid differentiation as its suppression has blocked erythroid differentiation and enhanced apoptosis. This lncRNA has been shown to suppress expression of the pro-apoptotic gene  Pycard  [ 48 ]. Linc-MAF-4 is a chromatin-related lncRNA with specific expression in T helper 1 cells. Its expression has been inversely correlated with expression of the T helper 2-associated transcription factor MAF. Linc-MAF-4 silencing has twisted T cell differentiation to the T helper 2 route [ 49 ]. H19 is another lncRNA with critical role in the emergence of HSCs. Absence of H19 in the early developmental stages has suppressed endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition. Besides, H19 deficiency in pre-HSCs has resulted in promoter hypermethylation and simultaneous down-regulation of numerous important hematopoietic transcription factors, such as Runx1 and Spi1. The detected defects in the hematopoietic system following H19 deficiency has been attributed to the enhanced function of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, a controller of DNA methylation [ 50 ]. An animal study has indicated the role of Xist RNA in the suppression of hematologic cancer as deletion of this lcRNA in the blood of mice has resulted in initiation of an extremely aggressive myeloproliferative condition being described by a number of characteristics including myelofibrosis and leukemia. Deficiency of this lncRNA in HSCs has resulted in abnormal maturation and age-dependent defects [ 51 ]. Dlk1-Gtl2 is another ncRNA with an important impact in inhibition of LT-HSCs. This locus contains a miRNA mega-cluster locus that inhibits the whole PI3K-mTOR pathway, suppressing mitochondrial synthetic processes and metabolic function and protecting LT-HSCs from reactive oxygen species (ROS) [ 52 ].

CR40	The alteration of TME leads to the polarization of TAMs into M1 macrophages, facilitating an immune response against the tumor. The M1 macrophages exhibit a strong antigen presentation ability as they express major histocompatibility complex class II and secrete various proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6, interleukin-12, inducible nitric oxide synthase, reactive oxygen species, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), which have the potential effect of killing cancer cells [ 38 ]. So, repolarizing TAMS into M1 macrophages leads to increased secretion of interleukin-12, which activates and recruits natural killer cells to carry out tumor cell killing in advanced tumors [ 39 ]. Additionally, the use of anti-Her2 antibodies in combination with anti-PD-L is beneficial in upregulating PD-L1 expression in macrophages [ 40 ]. Traditional Chinese medicine may also serve as a potential therapeutic option for breast cancer by promoting the repolarization of TAMs, with emodin and the XIAOPI formula being particularly effective in this regard. Emodin, a Chinese herbal medicine, exerts anti-tumorigenic impacts on breast cancer by suppressing the production of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1) in macrophages [ 41 ]. The key bioactive compound of the XIAOPI formula, Baohuoside I, has also been shown to block the polarization of TAMs’ M2 phenotype and severely restrict the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells [ 42 ]. Various macrophage functions and different treatment options for breast cancer are shown in Fig.  2 .

Different kinds of experimental traumatic brain injury models such as fluid percussive injury, 31 , 32  controlled cortical impact injury, 33 , 34  closed-head weight drop injury, 35  and acceleration-impact injury 36  have shown increased neural stem cells’ activation. All of these experimental studies have shown the most prevalent and notable endogenous cell response after traumatic brain injury is an elevated cell proliferation within neurogenic areas of the dentate gyrus and subventricular zone. It is well accepted that enhanced production of new neurons following the traumatic brain injury was detected predominantly in the hippocampus in the more seriously injured animals in many experimental studies. 37  More studies have discovered that injury-enhanced new granule neurons send out axonal projections into the targeted CA3 region implying their integration into the existing hippocampal circuitry, 37 , 38  and this injury-induced endogenous neurogenic stem cells’ response is directly associated with the inherent cognitive functional recovery after traumatic brain injury of rodents. 39 , 40	Different kinds of experimental traumatic brain injury models such as fluid percussive injury, 31 , 32  controlled cortical impact injury, 33 , 34  closed-head weight drop injury, 35  and acceleration-impact injury 36  have shown increased neural stem cells’ activation.

It has been reported to inhibit tumor-associated angiogenesis through the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation. It also enjoys antiproliferative and antimetastatic effects [ 137 ]. It downregulates the expression of survivin and β-catenin, inducing DNA damage and inhibiting the expression of DNA repair [ 136 , 138 ].

B69-polymers-15-00267	The widespread usage of pesticides, coloring agents, and PPCPs is a critical disquiet because they contaminate water and the majority of them are organic chemicals [ 69 ]. They can be hazardous to flora and fauna, and they can disrupt ecosystems by disrupting the oxygen/nitrogen balance in the water. They can spread and pollute a large region far beyond their point of origin through water flow. In many cases, only a trace amount of the contaminant is required to produce significant environmental and human health issues [ 70 ]. So, organic pollutants should be removed as much as possible before being discharged into a water system. Because of their broad, rigid, and persistent permeability, as well as appropriate surface FGs, COFs looked promising for massive organic compounds adsorption. Different adsorption methods have been observed depending on the impurities and the nature of COF functioning. Pore-size effect [ 71 ], H-bonding [ 72 ], hydrophobic interaction [ 68 ], and p–p interaction [ 73 ] are all major adsorption mechanisms, as shown in  Figure 5 . As evidenced by the capture of arylorganophosphorus flame retardants [ 74 ], pore size effects may sometimes become a significant cause in adsorptive removal.

As constituents in mixed-matrix membranes, a variety of COFs with varied pore apertures and covalent connections was studied. COFs as fillers have been utilized in these membranes, and they function in the same way that they do in polymer matrices. For this, the persistent matrix phase polymer and dispersed filler phase must have similar strong affinity [ 66 ]. In these membranes, a synergistic effect has been observed among COFs and the polymer matrix, resulting in enhanced composite absorption. The amount of COF that is loaded into the mixed-matrix membrane has a significant impact on extraction efficiency. Due to the sheer role of well-spaced-out channels, low COF impregnation improves separation performance. However, if there is moderate COF in the membrane, the gas transport channels can become clogged, resulting in poor performance. For example, separating membranes with 0.4 wt% of COF-5 had the best CO 2 /N 2  selectivity and CO 2  permeability when matched with other COF-5/polyether block amides (Pebax-1657 matrix), membranes which contain different COF loadings [ 69 ].

NO	Parents' Expectations of High Schools in Firearm Violence Prevention	NO	NO	In one survey, parents were supportive of school-law enforcement partnerships to promote safety and respond to violence in schools, and they also saw a relationship between improving mental health services generally and reducing school violence. (Payton et al., 2017).	Firearm violence remains a significant problem in the US (with 2787 adolescents killed in 2015). However, the research on school firearm violence prevention practices and policies is scant. Parents are major stakeholders in relation to firearm violence by youths and school safety in general. The purpose of this study was to examine what parents thought schools should be doing to reduce the risk of firearm violence in schools. A valid and Related questionnaire was mailed to a national random sample of 600 parents who had at least one child enrolled in a public secondary school (response rate=47%). Parents perceived inadequate parental monitoring/rearing practices (73%), peer harassment and/or bullying (58%), inadequate mental health care services for youth (54%), and easy access to guns (51%) as major causes of firearm violence in schools. The school policies perceived to be most effective in reducing firearm violence were installing an alert system in schools (70%), working with law enforcement to design an emergency response plan (70%), creating a comprehensive security plan (68%), requiring criminal background checks for all school personnel prior to hiring (67%), and implementing an anonymous system for students to report peer concerns regarding potential violence (67%).

Background: Focus group studies are increasingly published in health related journals, but we know little abouthow researchers use this method, particularly how they determine the number of focus groups to conduct. Themethodological literature commonly advises researchers to follow principles of data saturation, although practicaladvise on how to do this is lacking. Our objectives were firstly, to describe the current status of sample size infocus group studies reported in health journals.

Methods: We searched PubMed for studies that had used focus groups and that had been published in open access journals during 2008, and extracted data on the number of focus groups and on any explanation authorsgave for this number. We also did a qualitative assessment of the papers with regard to how number of groupswas explained and discussed. Results: We identified 220 papers published in 117 journals. In these papers insufficient reporting of sample sizes was common. The number of focus groups conducted varied greatly (mean 8.4, median 5, range 1 to 96).
